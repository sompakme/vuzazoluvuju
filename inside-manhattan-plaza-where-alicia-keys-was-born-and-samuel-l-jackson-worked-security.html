Jackson earned a paycheck as the building’s first security guard.</p><p>It didn’t take long for Manhattan Plaza — the massive 1,689-unit federally subsidized apartment complex that opened in June 1977 on a city block between <span data-scayt_word=42nd data-scaytid=2>42nd</span> and <span data-scayt_word=43rd data-scaytid=4>43rd</span>&nbsp;streets at Ninth Avenue — to establish itself as a creative hive filled with actors, singers, musicians, dancers, choreographers and comedians. Other tenants include Terrence Howard; Tennessee Williams; Angela <span data-scayt_word=Lansbury data-scaytid=5>Lansbury</span>; Mickey Rourke; Patrick Dempsey; Tom Fontana; and casting director Mary Jo Slater, the latter of whom teamed with director Alice Elliott and producer Ken <span data-scayt_word=Aguado data-scaytid=6>Aguado</span> to put it on film.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Miracle on <span data-scayt_word=42nd data-scaytid=3>42nd</span> Street</a>, which premieres at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival on Feb. 9, tells the inside story of the iconic building courtesy of some of its now-famous residents and narrator <span data-scayt_word=Chazz data-scaytid=130>Chazz</span> <span data-scayt_word=Palminteri data-scaytid=8>Palminteri</span>. The film, which does not yet have a distribution deal in place, came together with the help of additional producers like Elliott, Cindy Bond, Cindy Cowan, Erika <span data-scayt_word=Lockridge data-scaytid=9>Lockridge</span>, Sheila <span data-scayt_word=Maniar data-scaytid=10>Maniar</span>, Nancy M. Perkins, Lisa <span data-scayt_word=Shreve data-scaytid=11>Shreve</span>, Eric Small and Joanne <span data-scayt_word=Storkan data-scaytid=12>Storkan</span>. Other stars who sat for interviews include Donald <span data-scayt_word=Faison data-scaytid=13>Faison</span>, Estelle Parsons and <span data-scayt_word=Giancarlo data-scaytid=14>Giancarlo</span> Esposito.&nbsp;</p><p>Slater moved into a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment with “a beautiful terrace” in 1977 even though everyone in her life thought she was crazy to move to crime-riddled Times Square at that time. “It was nirvana in the middle of hell,” laughs Slater, who lived there until 1986, when she moved to Los Angeles to take a job as <span data-scayt_word=vp data-scaytid=15>vp</span> casting at MGM. “Outside there were crack pipes everywhere, but inside the plaza was heaven.”</p><p>Among the amenities were a bubble tennis court, hot tub, supermarket, florist, “fabulous restaurants” and&nbsp; Olympic-sized swimming pool that would freeze over in the winter to become an ice-skating rink. “I was the only casting director in the building so every actor loved me. I worked on One Life to Live&nbsp;during that time so I put many of them on the show so they could get health insurance,” recalls Slater, who moved in as a single mother raising a young son named Christian (yes, that Christian Slater) and she never had to worry about child care. (She laughs: “I never had to pay for a baby sitter.”)</p><p>Slater took the subsidy because she couldn’t make ends meet, meaning her rent was $220 a month. “That’s how I managed to live. It wasn’t a handout, it was a hand-up, ” recalls Slater, whose credits include Murder in the First, The Outer Limits, <span data-scayt_word=Stargate data-scaytid=16>Stargate</span> and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, among dozens of other TV shows and films. “It was a breeding ground for so many artists and the next Alicia Keys will definitely come out of there.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKq60qKbnmWdlruprdOtmKdloKGuu62MmqOim5mWeqyx2KxksJmjYq%2Bwvs1mqpqlpZq5briMo5ico6Oku27DzquinpxdqLKkwdGiq7JlYWWFc4KSbmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
