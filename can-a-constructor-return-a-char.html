While declaring a constructor you will not have anything like return type. In general, Constructor is implicitly called at the time of instantiation.<h2>What does a constructor function return?</h2>Usually, constructors do not have a return statement. Their task is to write all necessary stuff into this , and it automatically becomes the result. But if there is a return statement, then the rule is simple: If return is called with an object, then the object is returned instead of this .<h2>What return type do constructors have?</h2>A constructor doesn't have any return type. The data type of the value retuned by a method may vary, return type of a method indicates this value. A constructor doesn't return any values explicitly, it returns the instance of the class to which it belongs.<h2>Can a constructor return a void?</h2>Constructor is not like any ordinary method or function, it has no return type, thus it does not return void. Constructors don't create objects.<h2>Java Constructor Tutorial - Learn Constructors in Java</h2><p></p><h2>Can constructor be static?</h2>Java constructor can not be static<p>One of the important property of java constructor is that it can not be static. We know static keyword belongs to a class rather than the object of a class. A constructor is called when an object of a class is created, so no use of the static constructor.</p><h2>Can a constructor be overloaded?</h2>Constructors can be overloaded in a similar way as function overloading. Overloaded constructors have the same name (name of the class) but the different number of arguments. Depending upon the number and type of arguments passed, the corresponding constructor is called.<h2>Why constructor has no return type?</h2>So the reason the constructor doesn't return a value is because it's not called directly by your code, it's called by the memory allocation and object initialization code in the runtime. Its return value (if it actually has one when compiled down to machine code) is opaque to the user - therefore, you can't specify it.<h2>Which type of constructor Cannot have return type?</h2>A constructor cannot have a return type (not even a void return type). A common source of this error is a missing semicolon between the end of a class definition and the first constructor implementation. The compiler sees the class as a definition of the return type for the constructor function, and generates C2533.<h2>Can we write return statement in constructor in Java?</h2>There are no “return value” statements in the constructor, but the constructor returns the current class instance. We can write 'return' inside a constructor.<h2>Does constructor return any value in C++?</h2>A constructor does not support any return type.<h2>How many constructors can a class have?</h2>You can have 65535 constructors in a class(According to Oracle docs).<h2>What does a constructor do?</h2>A constructor is a special method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that initializes a newly created object of that type. Whenever an object is created, the constructor is called automatically.<h2>Can constructor be private?</h2>Yes, we can declare a constructor as private. If we declare a constructor as private we are not able to create an object of a class. We can use this private constructor in the Singleton Design Pattern.<h2>Can you make constructor final?</h2>No, a constructor can't be made final. A final method cannot be overridden by any subclasses. As mentioned previously, the final modifier prevents a method from being modified in a subclass. The main intention of making a method final would be that the content of the method should not be changed by any outsider.<h2>Can constructor throw an exception?</h2>The short answer to the question “can a constructor throw an exception in Java” is yes! Of course, properly implementing exceptions in your constructors is essential to getting the best results and optimizing your code.<h2>Can abstract methods have constructor?</h2>Yes! Abstract classes can have constructors! Yes, when we define a class to be an Abstract Class it cannot be instantiated but that does not mean an Abstract class cannot have a constructor. Each abstract class must have a concrete subclass which will implement the abstract methods of that abstract class.<h2>Which type of constructor Cannot?</h2>Explanation: The constructor cannot have a return type. It should create and return new objects. Hence it would give a compilation error.<h2>Can constructor have non access modifiers?</h2>Like methods, constructors can have any of the access modifiers: public, protected, private, or none (often called package or friendly). Unlike methods, constructors can take only access modifiers. Therefore, constructors cannot be abstract , final , native , static , or synchronized .<h2>Can constructor have parameters?</h2>A Java class constructor initializes instances (objects) of that class. Typically, the constructor initializes the fields of the object that need initialization. Java constructors can also take parameters, so fields can be initialized in the object at creation time.<h2>Should constructors be void?</h2>You cannot declare a constructor a void as it's a special function that makes different a constructor and a void function. It is recommended to have a constructor of every class if you don't create it ,it will be automatically created . Hope this helps.<h2>Can we use this () and super () in a method?</h2>this() and super(), both are the constructors that's why must be the first statement. But we can use both in a program. this(): It is used to call, same class Default or Parametrized Constructor. super(): It is used to call, immediate super/parent class Default or Parametrized Constructor.<h2>Can a class have 2 constructors?</h2>The technique of having two (or more) constructors in a class is known as constructor overloading. A class can have multiple constructors that differ in the number and/or type of their parameters. It's not, however, possible to have two constructors with the exact same parameters.<h2>Can constructor be virtual?</h2>In C++, constructor cannot be virtual, because when constructor of a class is executed there is no virtual table in the memory, means no virtual pointer defined yet. So, the constructor should always be non-virtual.<h2>Can a constructor be overridden?</h2>Constructor looks like method but it is not. It does not have a return type and its name is same as the class name. But, a constructor cannot be overridden. If you try to write a super class's constructor in the sub class compiler treats it as a method and expects a return type and generates a compile time error.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWaZXZi8r7%2FTq6ycrJ%2BnerOx066pp2WRYrCprdE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
