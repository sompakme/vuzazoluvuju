Fox&nbsp;Foundation.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When Fox later pondered why many notables in Hollywood, such as Swift and Reynolds, have had such an impact on society, organizations, causes and more, he explained, “What is it about Ryan Reynolds that everything he touches is gold? What is it about people in my position that get involved in causes and have success and progress? You just show up and do it. And you don’t worry about what everybody thinks, what everybody says, or what you get out of that.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">It also made him think about his own advocacy work following his Parkinson’s disease diagnosis in 1991. “I didn’t think about it,” he said. “I wanted to work on Parkinson’s because I want a cure.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He continued, “I just wanted to put us in the best position to find a cure, and hopefully, I did. And as far as other people, I think those are two good people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofK61wqGYnqRdn3qnu9dmmZ6kmZrDpr%2BMrZiypJ%2BnerTDyJ%2BrZqqplrtuvsSypaiklKh6qrnPmpqtZaekv62wjGppbG1obIN2g5Fo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
