"I fall in love with human beings based on who they are, not based on what they do or what sex they are," Woodley told the outlet.

"There have been times in my personal life where [I] want to experience something with someone, but you're so afraid because of whatever it is [so] you stop yourself."</p><p dir=ltr>However, Woodley also noted that she had someone, in particular, help her along her sexual journey. "I had a lover that taught me a lot about my own body and my own emotional connection to sex," she dished.
