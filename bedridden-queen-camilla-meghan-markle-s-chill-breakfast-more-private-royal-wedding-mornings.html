He described it as "the easiest process in the world" and said Meghan was "calm and chatty."</p><p id=eKsIAoI6t1T data-wc=51>Makeup artist Daniel Martin reiterated that the bride showed no pre-wedding jitters during their "chill morning" which included dining on cereal and fresh fruit.

She wrote: "I am told the bride's only anxiety on the wedding day itself was that her stomach rumbling might be picked up by a hot mic." So it's likely that a hearty breakfast that curbed any hunger pangs was on the cards.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Princess Eugenie's last-minute planning</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e60c0d235b54-gettyimages-1051955066.jpg><p id=ey6ndIAFV2RG data-wc=22>Aside from getting her hair and makeup done, Princess Eugenie was also finalising some last-minute details just hours before she got married.&nbsp;</p><p id=evBHNjIN98 data-wc=35>Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank had reportedly not decided on which carriage they would ride in but settled on the Scottish State Coach in order to prevent getting wet in the unpredictable British weather.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Queen Elizabeth's fashion mishap</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3acf96406154-shutterstockeditorial9164770i.jpg><p id=etDrsMPTN1RS data-wc=63>Queen Elizabeth II had several wardrobe mishaps on her wedding day in 1947.
