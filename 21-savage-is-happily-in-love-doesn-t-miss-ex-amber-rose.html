Ah, hell nah," he answered with a smile. The host said he was just making sure 21 Savage hadn't penned any tracks about Amber Rose on his record. "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I ain't made any songs</a> about her. She in a relationship!" He went on to say that there's a special woman in his life. "I'm happily in love. I got a family. I'm good."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Everyone wanted to know who the lucky lady might be, but 21 Savage wasn't giving up any details. "I can't really tell you all that," he said. "You can't let 'em know everything!... I'm happily in love. I'm married. I'm happy." It's&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">difficult to navigate</a> privacy in this celebrity-driven culture, so good for 21 for making it work.
