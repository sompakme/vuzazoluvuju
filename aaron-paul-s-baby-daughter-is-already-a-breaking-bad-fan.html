Aaron attended the 10-year anniversary of the show at San Diego Comic-Con on Wednesday, and walked onto stage in front of hundreds of fans while holding baby Story, who was dressed as a little version of Heisenberg in an adorable yellow onesie with matching goggles. Aaron's wife, Lauren, shared a snap of baby Story posing with her dad and co-star&nbsp;Bryan Cranston, and captioned the shot: "Breaking dads." She also posted two Instagram Stories of their little girl heading to the stage in the onesie, writing: "Tiny cook," and filmed the father and daughter as they took to the stage with her dad, writing: "Story is living her best life."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ebf6a0602869-aaron-paul-baby-1-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e3CE2hihKV5N data-wc=6><strong>Aaron visited Comic-Con with baby Story</strong></p><p id=eknqJyas_uSQ data-wc=56>Commenting on the adorable snap, one fan wrote: "Too cute for words!

The Jesse actor explained: "[Cranston] came up to me the first time he did it, and he just gives me a really long, exaggerated hug. I'm like, 'What's going on?' And he goes, 'Hey man. It's been a fun ride. You read the script right?' And then he just walks away! I run into the production office and I'm like, 'Where's the script?' He's like, 'It's not available yet.' I'm like, 'No, please God tell me!' And I read it and I was alive still."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
