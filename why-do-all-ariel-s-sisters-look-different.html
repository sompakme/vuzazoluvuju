It has to do with the fact that <b>they are mermaids, and how mermaids reproduce</b>. Mer-folk have their human parts on top and their fishy parts on the bottom, this is obvious. It follows that their reproductive organs are among the fishy parts below their waist.</span></span><h2>Are Ariel and her sisters the same age?</h2>Point of reference, Adella admits in Ariel's Beginning, to being two years older than Ariel, therefore, making her the fifth daughter.<h2>Do Ariel and her sisters have the same mom?</h2>Background. Queen Athena was the wife of King Triton, and the mother of Ariel and her six older sisters.<h2>Is Ariel's aunt Ursula?</h2>Ursula was originally conceived as Triton's sister, which would have naturally made the character Ariel's aunt, but the idea was ultimately abandoned. However, their blood relationship is still vaguely alluded to when the character mentions a time during which she actually lived in Triton's palace.<h2>Who's the oldest Disney princess?</h2>Snow White is the first and oldest Disney princess, who debuted in 1937.

Cinderella and Tiana are the oldest, both 19 years old.<h2>Who is the least popular Disney princess?</h2>Based on USA Today's ranking, Aurora takes last place in terms of the “best” Disney princesses, which is totally understandable. She's known for being beautiful and for sleeping, but that's pretty much it.<h2>Why is Ariel's hair red?</h2>According to the official Disney blog, red was chosen for Ariel partly to distinguish her from Hannah, and partly because red is green's complementary color. Ariel's tail was always going to be green which is to this day known in-house at Disney as "Ariel" green.<h2>Is Disney making a Ursula movie?</h2>Melissa McCarthy will be starring as the sea witch named Ursula. Ursula used to live in the underwater palace but was banished and exiled.<h2>How did Ariel's mum died?</h2>Unfortunately, she died as a result of a run-in with a big pirate ship when Ariel was very young, fueling Triton's hatred of humans and music as a result. A statue of her dancing with him is present in his courtyard, where he cried over her death every day.<h2>What is Ariel's last name?</h2>Ariel is the seventh-born daughter of King Triton and Queen Athena of an underwater kingdom of merfolk called Atlantica. She has no last name.<h2>Why did the mermaids try to drown Wendy?</h2>Mermaids appear in the film when Peter takes Wendy to their lagoon to meet them. They happily welcome Peter and gather around him to hear his stories. However, when they see Wendy, they become jealous and attempt to drown her. They assault her by splashing her with their tails.<h2>Who is Ariel's favorite sister?</h2>Princess Arista is a minor character in Disney's 1989 film The Little Mermaid and later became one of the main characters in The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning. She was voiced by Grey DeLisle in the prequel film.<h2>What age did Ariel get married?</h2>Occasionally she meant to turn back and return to Eric, but somehow it never happened. The feeling that he once inspired in her was now how she felt about the wider world. She also finally figured out that she was only sixteen when they got married, and you know, people change.<h2>Who is the oldest sister in The Little Mermaid?</h2>Princess Attina is the firstborn daughter of King Triton and Queen Athena. And the oldest sibling of Ariel. She has an orange tail and wears a matching seashell bikini top.<h2>Is Ariel's father Poseidon?</h2>Poseidon is the father of King Triton, and therefore the paternal grandfather of Ariel and her sisters. He is, presumably, the son of Triton's Grandpa Neptune.<h2>How old is Prince Eric meant to be?</h2>According to the film's official novelization, Eric had just turned 18 in the film, which would make him two years older than Ariel. Eric is voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes in the original film and Kingdom Hearts II, by Jeff Bennett in the prequel television series, and by Rob Paulsen in the direct-to-video sequel.<h2>Is Ariel a ginger?</h2>Disney's animators originally wanted Ariel to be a blonde, but they ended up making her a redhead so she wouldn't look too similar to the mermaid, played by Daryl Hannah, in the film Splash, which was wildly popular and came out a just few years before The Little Mermaid (per Oh My Disney).<h2>What is Disney's darkest movie?</h2>Arguably the darkest film in the entire Disney animated canon is the 1996 film The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
