In light of his firing, it appears Anthem wanted ot present his firing as a mutual departure.</p><p>Anthem Sports & Entertainment Inc. caused a stir in the wrestling community by naming Anthony Cicione as the new President of TNA Wrestling, displacing long-time President Scott D’Amore. D’Amore’s exit signaled the conclusion of an era, during which he played a key role in steering TNA through numerous changes and obstacles.</p><p>Sean Ross Sapp behind Fightful’s paywall reported that despite Scott D’Amore’s strong efforts to remain with the promotion, Anthem released him, framing it as a “mutual departure.” It was noted that his termination was planned a month prior to the announcement.</p><p>”The wheels were in motion for D’Amore’s termination a month prior. D’Amore adamantly did not want to leave TNA, though Anthem had stated that they wished to present it as a mutual departure.”</p><p>D’Amore was firm in denying that his departure was a “mutual decision.” TNA Wrestling talent were informed that D’Amore stepped down, but this was not accurate. Due to Ontario’s strict employment laws, it was in D’Amore’s best interest not to agree that his departure was mutual for his future prospects.</p><p>In the aftermath of his termination, reports emerged detailing the circumstances surrounding D’Amore’s firing,&nbsp;<a href=#>including his unsuccessful attempt to purchase TNA</a>. We will have to wait and see what will become of Scott D’Amore in the end.</p><p>What’s your opinion on this Scott D’Amore story? Where do you think he should go next?
