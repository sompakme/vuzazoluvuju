As Pearl Jam's <a href=#>Eddie Vedder</a> writes for<a href=#>&nbsp;Rolling Stone</a> (who listed The Who as the 29th greatest musical artist ever), "They wanted to be louder, so they had Jim Marshall invent the 100-watt amp. Needed more volume, so they began stacking them. It is said that the first guitar feedback ever to make it to record was on 'Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere,' in 1965." He continues, talking about Pete Townshend's guitar-smashing. And of course, any rock fan knows late drummer Keith Moon trashed hotel rooms (per<a href=#>&nbsp;Ultimate Classic Rock</a>). Others have done the same, but they did it first.</p><p dir=ltr>But The Who's legacy stretches beyond power chords and partying until dawn. "The Who told stories within the confines of a song," continues Vedder, "and, over the course of an entire album, pushed boundaries." He goes on to say "The Who quite possibly remain the greatest live band ever." That's subjective. But watch their shows and it's hard to argue they don't deserve to be a part of that conversation.</p><p dir=ltr>On "My Generation," Pete Townshend famously shouted, "I hope I die before I get old!" It didn't happen. He and frontman Roger Daltry, who still has that golden voice, are in their '70s. But as folk rocker Willie Nile said, according to a<a href=#>&nbsp;2010 New York Post</a> article, "They're still playing. Obviously it's not the '60s, '70s, or '80s, but the glory's still there."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDlG1nbGxfory0wIyipKmnoqmur8CMq6aco12Xrq%2Bw0mamn2WknbJufZhvZ6xn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
