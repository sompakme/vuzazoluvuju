Many viewers thought the comments were racist and insensitive. "You can really tell the ‘Karma (Remix)’ was done last minute for damage control to clear Taylor Swift & her [Nazi] boyfriend image after he said all those racist slurs to Ice Spice," one user wrote about the collab.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Swift announced the collaboration earlier this week</a> on social media. She wrote in an Instagram post to fans, "Um. SO much to tell you. I’m a massive fan of this brilliant artist and after getting to know her I can confirm: she is THE ONE to watch." She continued, writing, "So delighted to say that Karma Featuring the incredible&nbsp;@icespice will be out TOMORROW night at MIDNIGHT ET as a part of the new Midnights (Til Dawn Edition) deluxe album that you can pre-order now at store.taylorswift.com!" <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">The music video for the remix also dropped</a> today, and despite pushback against the collab, some fans seem to see the pair as a good match.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Caroline Fisher is a News Writer at HotNewHipHop from Chicago, Illinois.
