However, her fans are not only excited to see her on the big screen again but also concerned about her apparent "bad and bizarre" plastic surgery. Many have taken to social media to express their disappointment and sadness over the Hollywood darling's changed appearance.</p><p>One Twitter user wrote: "Great to see Meg Ryan back with her bread and butter, but lord I wish she didn't mess with her face." Another user joked: "Rename the film...What Happens With Meg Ryan's Face." Fans of the actress are expressing their love for her while also lamenting the changes in her once fresh-faced appearance. "I love Meg Ryan, but what happened to her face? She was so beautiful with big expressive eyes," said one fan.</p><p>Despite speculation, Ryan has <a href=#>not admitted to getting any work done</a>. However, celebrity facial plastic surgeon Dr. Sam Rizk believes that she not only went under the knife but also got a botched procedure.</p><p>"She's a mess," he said. "I think she had a bad facelift in the wrong direction, sideways, instead of vertical." Rizk pointed out that the telltale sign of the horizontal surgery is Ryan's mouth, which he believes has been pulled sideways.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Meg had bad cosmetic procedures</h2><p>Rizk also thinks that Ryan's lips have been enhanced with fillers, making them appear larger and uneven. He also suspects that her cheeks have been injected with either filler or fat, giving them a doughy appearance that was never there before. With fuller cheeks, her eyes appear smaller.</p><p>"When you have a lot of filler or fat in your cheeks and you smile, where does it go? The cheeks go up, and what's above the cheek, the eyes," explained Rizk.</p><p>Ryan once addressed speculation about her changing looks by diverting to another topic. "There are more important conversations than how women look and how they are aging," she told Porter magazine in 2015. "I love my age. I love my life right now...I love the person I've become, the one I've evolved into."</p><p>While fans may be disappointed by Ryan's changed appearance, it's important to remember that everyone has the right to do what makes them happy. As Ryan herself said, there are more important conversations than how women look and how they are aging.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZraGJofHJ9jmlraG5laYOifJJxaWtuYGaxeXyUa2%2BbbGVrsm%2B006aj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
