I could see from the way he behaved — he talked like that, and he speaks in a very peculiar way for a man who is as old as my oldest son, 35. And he didn't want me to swear."</p><p>• "I had asked him if he was a virgin and he sort of laughed and giggled, and he called me Brando," the actor added. "He said, 'Oh, Brando'. I said, 'Well, what do you do for sex?' And he was acting fussy and embarrassed."</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-entertainment">Related articles</h2><p>• "He said he hated his father and started to cry. So I pulled back. I started to tiptoe. I realised that he was in trouble with his life because he was living in a never-never land."</p><p>• "I said, 'Well, who are your friends?' He said, 'I don't know anybody my own age. I don't like anybody my own age'. I said, 'Why not?' He said, 'I don't know, I don't know'. He was crying hard enough that … I tried to assuage him. I tried to help him all I could."</p><p>• Brando told prosecutors: "With this mode of behaviour that's been going on, I think it's pretty reasonable to conclude that he may have had something to do with kids. My impression was that he didn't want to answer because he was frightened to answer me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6or7LqKVmmqKWu6W7jJymp56ipLu1scNmpKKbmJayrXnJmpqkq5%2BjerDCxKtkrJ2oqq6tecCbrKydXZa5rbHGmquip56ofIujpJCChoSGg6eRkLiTen2CZH%2BBkJihgIOOZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
