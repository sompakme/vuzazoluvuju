It is perhaps most important during a tracking shot than in any other shots. The camera has its own movements to pinpoint, so you either dismiss or narrow down the space for improvisation.</p><p>The setting of the scene goes hand in hand with the blocking as well. Often, the movements cannot be rehearsed without the exact <a href=#>location of the shooting space</a>. Blocking and setting add the biggest elements of interest to the simplest and longest tracking shots. As such, it is important to make sure they all add to your story in the most engaging and enhancing ways.</p><p>With blocking, the camera operator and actors can take note of their speed and the duration of the scene once played out. This is also why it’s crucial to have a location that suits your vision early on in the process. Your crew and actors can successfully block the scene on-site, ensuring they’re fully prepared by the time the cameras roll.</p><p>To keep everyone on the same page, it is smart to <a href=#>create a shot list</a> of your tracking shot, whatever length it may be, into separate shots. Break down your tracking shot into individual compositions. This can serve as checkpoints for everyone, making the process of creating this complex movement a lot simpler.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Get inspired by the experts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/los-angeles-eclectic-hollywood-lounge-1024x683.webp><p>Let’s look at another scene from a cinematic classic that utilizes one of the best tracking shots. This scene from 1990’s Goodfellas is another popular long-take example:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>It is a brilliant cinematic shot because it hits all the themes of the movie in one seamless and naturalistic shot. The scene also introduces us to how far Henry Hill, the protagonist, can go. He’s wanted the privilege, respect, and command of a room that accompanies a life of crime. Not to mention his desire for wealth and luxury.</p><p>As Henry Hill attempts to win over his date, he simultaneously woos the audience. And as he enters the back of the club, believing he can skip the line much as he’s skipped the everyday work to gain that life of privilege, we as an audience understand who we are dealing with. That is what an excellent tracking shot reveals: a clear storyline, a compelling character, and smooth motion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tracking shot: conclusion</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/houston-music-production-studio-1024x685.jpg><p>In the end, don’t obsess yourself with trying to create the most extensive shot in cinematic history — at least not yet. It’s important to plan what you want to say with each shot. If the tracking shot is the most effective way to do it, then by all means do it. Just remember to do it with purpose and, most of all, have fun.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><a href=#>Peerspace</a> can streamline your tracking shot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/las-vegas-car-tunnel-1024x683.jpg><p>Now that you’re all caught up on what a tracking shot is, we bet you want to try it for yourself, right?
