We need this protected there.” It was like a fairy godmother,” she said. Cattrall wished she had more protection in the past, but SAG-AFTRA, the TV and film union for actors, didn’t introduce the on-set role until 2019. It was a position that came out of <a href=# rel=noopener>the #MeToo movement to help prevent sexual harassment</a> and create a safe space for actors when they filmed nude scenes. It’s a 180-degree pivot from the&nbsp;Sex and the City for Cattrall. “The most I ever got was for [costume designer] Pat Field to make this — she called it a “K.C. Cup” [“Kim Cattrall Cup”] that would cover, like a jockstrap, both actors if the scene required it,” she explained.</p><p>While Cattrall is protective of Samantha, she is definitely not returning to the show — like ever. And there was always one requirement to portraying the character to its fullest — nudity. “I don’t want to be nude anymore,” she summed up. “I’m 65. <a href=# rel=noopener>I’m in great shape</a>. But I’m just not interested. I feel like I filled my quota on that one — and without an intimacy coach.”</p><p><strong>Before you go, click <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a> to see actors who have spoken out about pressure to get naked for a role.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pressured-to-get-naked.jpg alt="Halle Berry" width=693 height=390 sizes="(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nkafBqq%2FLnqpoamVrgnODkmiioqVdmK61wNGao6VlnqqxpnnLqK2eZaOYsq%2Bx0maqnrBdlruledOhnGabmanGcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
