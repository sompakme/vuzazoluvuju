Due to his star power, and because&nbsp;of how well he’s performed, a lot of eyes are on The Maverick. However, it seems Logan had a hilarious reaction to seeing his doppelgänger, proving that there’s always room for a copy.</p><p>Logan shared&nbsp;a really humorous TikTok just days before he competed for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at Crown Jewel. In the video, Logan runs into his doppelgänger, and the YouTuber is shocked by how much they resemble one another. Logan’s hilarious reaction is captured in the interaction’s video clip.</p><p>There is no doubt that the two appear to be extremely similar from a distance. They share the same physical characteristics, as well as the same taste in clothing and hairstyle. While Logan’s doppelgänger does appear to be a little older than Logan when you look closely, there have&nbsp;still strong similarities in their faces.</p><p>It was clear from the comments on the TikTok video that it’s not just Logan who noticed the resemblance between him and his doppelgänger. However, Logan will face Roman Reigns this Sunday at Crown Jewel for the Undisputed WWE Universal Title. Odds are, his doppelgänger will be watching from home.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><span class=author-name>Smita Singha Roy</span> <span></span><p>Smita is majoring in engineering and she loves to learn about new things.
