Since then, he's been mostly focused on his music with a Gift & a Curse putting him back on the map in 2023. Now, however, Gunna is facing allegations from another YSL co-defendant – Trontavious "Slug" Stephens – who's been on the witness stand for a minute now. According to Thugger's business partner, his "Hot" collaborator is one of the gang members who was a part of the Young Slime Life collective. Mostly Bloods are tied to the group, however, some Crips apparently were too.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-gunna-has-ties-to-crips-trontavious-slug-stephens-says-in-court>Gunna Has Ties to Crips, Trontavious "Slug" Stephens Says in Court</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Is Gunna a Crip?" one prosecutor asked Slug during his time on the stand on Monday (January 22). As per HipHopDX, the latter simply responded, "Yeah." In the past, the embattled lyricist was denied bond due to his alleged links to Atlanta's Shady Park Crips. "[My client] is not involved in any of the so-called Shady Park Crips matters," his attorney declared back in 2022.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While Gunna's name is being brought up in the Georgia courtroom full of his old friends, the "fukumean" hitmaker's been <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">booked and busy</a> overseas amid Paris Fashion Week.
