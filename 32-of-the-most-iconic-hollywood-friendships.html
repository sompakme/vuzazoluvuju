So when actors become friends—publicly supporting each other, going to events together, doing fun celebrity things like hanging out on a yacht—it warms our collective hearts. This is especially true when these two celebrities might have dated, did date, or were rumored to have dated (while most of the friends on this list did not, we have a couple on here that might have started out as romantic partners!) but then went on to become platonic soulmates. I have no doubt that there are actors who support each other behind the scenes, which is also admirable, but I can't help it: When celebs profess public support for each other, it gets a big "Awwww!" from me. Luckily, we've had quite a few famous pals over the years—including several odd ones you might not have known about.</p><p>Below, 32 of the most iconic Hollywood friendships of all time.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-and-stevie-nicks-3>Harry Styles and Stevie Nicks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/39qt6cTA7rKAW4ZS55AQJX-1920-80.jpeg><p>These two musical icons met in 2015 when Styles went to see Nicks perform; The two have shown lots of public support and have even performed together. In an interview with Zane Lowe, Nicks said, "He that kind of friend. He’s a brother, and a son, and maybe we’re best, best friends in another life or something."</p><h2 id=fred-astaire-and-ginger-rogers-3>Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NrcEdx3hEPot29qSaUmoxm-1920-80.jpeg><p>Granted, this one might not have been two BFFs working together; There were rumors of on and off fights between this iconic dancing couple. But Rogers in her memoir wrote, “Take it from me, no matter what you hear, Fred and I were always friends and professionally compatible,”&nbsp;and Astaire added, "Ginger was certainly the most effective partner I had.”</p><h2 id=cameron-diaz-and-drew-barrymore-3>Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xa74nxczTRC9ZyCofVEpRX-1920-80.jpeg><p>After they met on the set of Charlie's Angels, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz became inseparable (Diaz has even appeared on Barrymore's show!). Speaking to the L.A. Times, Diaz said, "I have absolute faith in her. You can’t even comprehend how hard it was to be her as a child, and then she shot out the other end with the ability to save herself.”</p><h2 id=nicole-kidman-and-naomi-watts-3>Nicole Kidman and Naomi Watts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3FJurfUSSWbDeYegrxToKD-1920-80.jpeg><p>It's hard to be an up-and-coming actress in Hollywood, and luckily for Naomi Watts and Nicole Kidman, they had each other. Watts has even admitted that it's tough for actors to be friends (given the competitive nature of the business), but that the two Aussies have a "sisterhood": "We've gone through a lot together over a significant amount of time."</p><h2 id=mary-j-blige-and-taraji-p-henson-3>Mary J. Blige and Taraji P. Henson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u4X53gMdzs3uBkV2H9MPdH-1920-80.jpeg><p>After connecting on the set of 2009's&nbsp;I Can Do Bad All By Myself, these two have vacationed together, supported each other, and been candid together. Blige spoke about Henson when the latter received a Hollywood walk of fame star: "We meet people in the industry and they're not nice. I've never had a friend that I can call while I'm on set and say, 'How do I do this as an actress' and you helped me when I needed help. And in my mind, that's rare, because people don't share and you're a sharer. So thank you for being a giver and a sharer."</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

Short has said of Martin, "Steve's best quality is who he is as a man...He's very moral, he's very loyal, very, very ethical. And this is beyond all that talent."</p><h2 id=dean-martin-sammy-davis-jr-and-frank-sinatra-3>Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Frank Sinatra</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LzTA8dHncT5jnNo4iNtrQM-1920-80.jpeg><p>Foundational members of the Rat Pack, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Frank Sinatra were colleagues and friends for a long time. The three even staged a reunion tour in 1987 called Together Again. Martin had to withdraw not far into the tour and was replaced by Liza Minnelli, and Davis would be diagnosed with cancer in 1989, so this would be the last time the three would perform.</p><h2 id=anderson-cooper-and-andy-cohen-3>Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rM3gmNe3yG7AnuT3YYwmqb-1920-80.jpeg><p>Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen had mutual friends who tried to set them up in the 1990s, but the two actually connected and became friends years later.

She was interested in him romantically, but their relationship turned into a strong platonic one after he came out to her. Their relationship was called one between soul mates, and Taylor even came to his aid after he crashed his car outside her house.</p><h2 id=mindy-kaling-and-bj-novak-3>Mindy Kaling and BJ Novak</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vzoSWU7nmqub2GjUPbx6B7-1920-80.jpeg><p>Granted—these two dated while on the set of The Office in the 2000s (2004-2007). But the two went on to be platonic besties; The two have since collaborated together, and Novak has called them "inseparable best friends." He's even godfather to Kaling's daughter!</p><h2 id=dolly-parton-and-sylvester-stallone-3>Dolly Parton and Sylvester Stallone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SRupu6siDXFufRXuR9DE3L-1920-80.jpeg><p>This one always makes me chuckle: Dolly Parton and Sylvester Stallone met on the set of the '80s comedy Rhinestone and became apparently the best of friends. Seriously, the two have raved over each other, with Stallone insisting, "The most fun I ever had on a movie was with Dolly Parton on&nbsp;Rhinestone.”</p><h2 id=ryan-reynolds-and-rob-mcelhenney-3>Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5c6k8U2WuBCbDs56sHTVn5-1920-80.jpeg><p>Imagine being so close with your friend (and, you know, being rich enough) that you buy a soccer team together? Well, that's just what <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/ryan-reynolds/>Ryan Reynolds</a> and Rob McElhenney did with Wrexham.

Lol! No matter what you call it, though, they have deep love for each other. Thompson has explained, “We’re so close, we vibrate on the same frequency.

Per People, Lively's daughter&nbsp;James has a cameo&nbsp;on Swift's&nbsp;song "Gorgeous," and all three daughters,&nbsp;James, Inez and Betty, are named-dropped in her album&nbsp;Folklore.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-and-sophie-turner-3>Taylor Swift and Sophie Turner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dH9rjE2uqWBhhWxuw6S9UC-1920-80.jpeg><p>If you keep up with celebrity news, you'll be familiar with this photo (where Taylor Swift showed public support for <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/sophie-turner/>Sophie Turner</a>, in the midst of a public divorce, by taking her out in New York), but the two met officially in 2019 and professed support for each other before the events of 2023.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-and-selena-gomez-3>Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hGdeP56RpmSCUTUuCZf6bi-1920-80.jpeg><p>These two met because they were both dating a Jonas Brother at the time (lol) and the two struck up an indelible, public friendship—from going out on the town in New York to appearing onstage together (and Gomez making a cameo in Swift's "Bad Blood" video!).</p><h2 id=tina-fey-and-amy-poehler-3>Tina Fey and Amy Poehler</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CrcmEB9ESJCieQDqaWDudd-1920-80.jpeg><p>The comedy duo we always love to see—Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, naturally—actually met while doing improv in Chicago in 1993. What followed included several professional collaborations (<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/saturday-night-live/>SNL</a>, Wine Country, Baby Mama, Sisters) as well as costarring in the best movie: Mean Girls.</p><h2 id=maisie-williams-and-sophie-turner-3>Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5KsXHRhSJnXnSMscTFLBzL-1920-80.jpeg><p>When Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams played sisters on the set of the intense HBO show <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/game-of-thrones/>Game of Thrones</a>, they became like sisters. “We got the role at the same time and we grew up on the show together and it was so amazing to have another person who was going through it at the same time because I think I just would have, it would have been too much otherwise,” Williams said on the “Table Manners” podcast.</p><h2 id=meghan-markle-and-serena-williams-3>Meghan Markle and Serena Williams</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PvS8ZHanBJfRLLcHErjeUQ-1920-80.jpeg><p>Even after becoming a royal, Meghan Markle stayed in touch with her celebrity friends (most notably the cast from Suits); This seemingly random pairing is my favorite, as <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/serena-williams/>Serena Williams</a> and Markle met at the Super Bowl in 2010, reunited at the 2014 Super Bowl, and the two hit it off—becoming instantly supportive of each other.</p><h2 id=jane-fonda-and-lily-tomlin-3>Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w58izRnDcBoybpDQLiFwP-1920-80.jpeg><p>From 9 to 5 to Grace and Frankie, these two actors weren't just friends—they were collaborators.

Who knew that when Martha Stewart would invite Snoop Dogg onto her show to make mashed potatoes in 2008, it was spark a years-long friendship, including professional collaborations like co-hosting, roasting, and—of course—more cooking.</p><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio-and-kate-winslet-3>Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZzfDM24tuvniqPQAtprGE-1920-80.jpeg><p>Even though the two never dated, this falls into the category of "celebs that fans 'ship...hard."
