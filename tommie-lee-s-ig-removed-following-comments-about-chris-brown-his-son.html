The reality star is known for her hot-headed reactions, and while some find it all entertaining, Lee is facing a wave of backlash. Lee and Natalie Nunn have been promoting their upcoming <a href=# rel>celebrity boxing match </a>for weeks. It will air on the Zeus network this Saturday, but to help hype the bout, the pair have engaged in social media antics. It has certainly helped increase interest, but things went left after they were invited to <a href=# class=text-word rel>Chris Brown</a>'s concert in London.</p><p>According to Nunn and her Baddies costars, Lee embarrassed them when she allegedly lashed out. According to reports, Brown's son Aeko was with his mother, Ammika Harris, when Lee noticed the little boy. Someone closed the door in her face, reportedly to shield the boy from the public. Lee allegedly became angry and tried to break the door down. She denied this occurred and while on Livestream, said it was Harris who slammed a door. "<a href=# rel>F*ck your baby and his daddy, too</a>," she said during a rant.</p><span><h6 id=h-tommie-lee-apologizes-to-chris-brown><strong>Tommie Lee Apologizes To Chris Brown</strong></h6></span><p>Lee appeared at a press conference for her Nunn fight, and it was then that she offered an apology. “I want to start off by addressing the elephant in the room. I love the children, <a href=# rel>I love the children,</a>” she said. It seemed she took note of the pushback. “I just want to apologize to Chris Brown and his baby mother ‘cause it’s not my character.”</p><p>Meanwhile, social media users quickly noted that not long after Lee made her comments, her Instagram page vanished. Some thought she deleted it due to the controversy, but Lee has been involved in more tense moments and stayed online. It is unclear why the account disappeared, but it was suggested that it was a move out of her control. She was teased about the page's removal, but she only reappeared on her business account.</p><span><h6><strong>Tommie Lee Refuses To Be Intimidated By The Public</strong></h6></span><p>In response, Lee made it clear that she wouldn't be silenced. "Oh pls I wish I would let y'all run me off the internet," she wrote on her Instagram Story. "Yea right the hater did what they do and my sh*t took!" She further stated, "I love when the whole world against me it actually makes me feel closer to God!!!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaINxfpVmq6ilnZ6ybrjEnqpmoZdiv6a5zq%2BcnWWWpLmtu9aipaBlk6S6rrHNrapmmZKkwrV5wqGpoqtdl7%2Bww81mn6KrXai8rw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
