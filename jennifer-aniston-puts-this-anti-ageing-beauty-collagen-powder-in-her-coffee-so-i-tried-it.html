But what is collagen? It’s a skin-firming protein that strengthens all of the above, promoting elasticity and hydration. And to be able to get a boost of the anti-ageing wonder so easily every day with just a scoop of powder… What’s not to love?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/05ca6240093e-jennifer-aniston-in-kitchen-adding-vital-proteins-to-coffee.jpg><p id=eA5AQbCmMsJq data-wc=65>Well, when I opened up the Vital Proteins canister - it’s a very fine powder that comes in an industrial-looking plastic tub with a scoop included – one of the things I was most worried about was the taste. As someone who has a very sensitive sense of smell and taste, I can tell you there was nearly no scent at all, which was promising.</p><p id=e9kCSOLmSilS data-wc=48>I really should have read the instructions, though - my first time trying the collagen powder was a disaster. I jumped right in and dumped a scoop into some cold water. Basic chemistry should have told me that was a mistake! It congealed into a sticky, gluey substance.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/92301c7065da-jennifer-aniston-collagen-supplements-z.jpg><p id=eD4jLLcjIMdK data-wc=52>While I was a little put off, I consulted with my knowledgeable friend Google and a quick search told me that the proper way to add it to cold drinks is to put a scoop into a very small amount of room temperature water and stir to dissolve before adding it in.</p><p id=e3fv6m6EjAue data-wc=43>After that easy hack - wow, I was impressed! Although if it’s in nothing but water there is a very, and I mean VERY faint, nearly unnoticeable gelatin-like taste, in recipes and drinks, it’s completely flavour free and doesn’t change the consistency, either.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKFpxGIZIw data-wc=41>Don't expect it to be like a creamer, it doesn't add any creaminess at all (although there is a different Vital Proteins powder for that), and there's another caveat: this powder is not vegan, so steer clear if that's an issue.</p><p id=eQeG9-uFDWzJ data-wc=29>I’ve tried it in smoothies, food recipes and what turns out to be the most no-fuss way: like Jen drinks it, in a hot cup of coffee every morning.</p><p id=e3UO_0W6GHLF data-wc=67>I wanted to make sure I wasn’t missing something - maybe my sensitive senses weren’t on point this time? - so I checked out some of the reviews on Amazon. Overall, shoppers agreed, with comments like “This product is amazing… doesn’t change the flavour of my drink but I notice the benefits” and “Does what it says!! No flavour so goes straight in my morning coffee! Easy!!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1e35f6fd516a-jennifer-aniston-sipping-drink.jpg><p id=eYbcpkuHmL5w data-wc=50>And as far as effectiveness for a beauty boost, the powder earns rave reviews, too. “I’ve used the entire container and I’ve noticed my hair is growing faster and looks better, my skin is clearer and looks great, and my nails are growing quicker and getting thicker,” said one shopper.</p><p id=eEbYun4oE7e0 data-wc=28>I’m not really surprised that it got Jennifer Aniston’s approval - in fact she became the Chief Creative Officer of Vital Proteins after swearing by it “for years”.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Jennifer Aniston just revealed her secret smoothie ingredient – and no wonder she looks so good" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8b8caee0a189-jennifer-aniston-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Jennifer Aniston just revealed her secret smoothie ingredient – and no wonder she looks so good" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Jennifer Aniston just revealed her secret smoothie ingredient – and no wonder she looks so good</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Jennifer Aniston's favourite moisturiser is just £5 in the Amazon spring sale" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/a06df8b1b999-jen-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Jennifer Aniston's favourite moisturiser is just £5 in the Amazon spring sale" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Jennifer Aniston's favourite moisturiser is just £5 in the Amazon spring sale</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eXMOGSKpJCQr data-wc=64>&nbsp;"Collagen is the glue that holds everything together.
