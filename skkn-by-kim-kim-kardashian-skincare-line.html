So it’s no surprise she has finally put her own spin on skincare. The mogul <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/a40167680/kim-kardashian-relaunching-skincare-line-skkn-by-kim/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="announced her namesake skincare brand" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">announced her namesake skincare brand</a>, SKKN BY KIM, in early June—and the long-awaited line is finally here.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With the collection of products, Kardashian is giving fans a direct line to how she maintains her skin. Her not-so-simple secret? A nine-step routine she’s curated with the help of experts like celebrity facialist Joanna Czech (Kardashian’s go-to skincare guru for almost a decade).</p><img alt="skkn by kim" title="skkn by kim" width=2500 height=1876 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/skkn-kks-2022-kim-kardashian-rgb-jpeg-144-dpi-17l-1655988252.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Skkn By Kim</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The two put their brains together to come up with a routine that mimics one Czech created for Kardashian over the years. Kardashian has been vocal about her struggle with psoriasis, which she credits as the fuel behind her fascination with skincare, so she claims her line is ideal for all skin types, tones, and most conditions. While there’s a lot of buzz around the line, we got to try the entire routine ahead of the major launch—and have some thoughts.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What Products Does SKKN BY KIM Consist Of?<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The nine-step routine is pretty well rounded: It's made up of a cleanser, toner, exfoliator, hyaluronic acid serum, vitamin C8 serum, face cream, eye cream, oil drops, and night oil. But what you might notice first about the line is the minimalist, architectural packaging (that’s also refillable). <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a40374291/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-helped-skkn/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kanye West is behind" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Kanye West is behind</a> the sleek design shapes and fonts, which is apparent after you see the lineup.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I had the chance to get a facial from Czech herself using exclusively SKKN BY KIM products. And while my skin looked spectacular and snatched post-treatment, I couldn't help but feel a lot of the end result had to do with Czech's magic hands and high-tech tools.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So I decided to test the line on my own for a week. Here, I share my full review of each product, detailing which products I think are worth investing in—for reasons other than the counter-worthy packaging.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Are the Products Worth It?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Cleanser</strong><strong> ($43):</strong><strong></strong> This light foaming cleanser removes makeup and dirt nicely—without stripping the skin, thanks to hydrating glycerin. I love the creamy cleanser as a second cleanse or a gentle morning cleanse. But if you’re looking for a deep clean, this won’t cut it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Exfoliator ($55):</strong> I’ve had my fair share of exfoliating faux pas, so this super-gentle one felt amazing on my skin without being too abrasive. Czech recommends mixing the cleanser and exfoliator together for a lighter exfoliation.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Toner ($45):</strong> This toner is packed with AHAs and fruit enzymes, which continues the exfoliation theme and leaves a nice glow. The texture feels like water, so it leaves skin feeling refreshed. If physical exfoliating is too harsh for you, this toner works wonders.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Hyaluronic-Acid Serum ($90):</strong> Off the bat, if you’re sensitive to fragrance, then this serum is not for you. In addition to multiple molecular weights of hyaluronic acid, this serum has a rose essence that gives a strong floral scent. However, I love that it has a few <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/a25573129/hyaluronic-acid-for-skin-benefits-uses/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="different-sized molecules of HA" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">different-sized molecules of HA</a> (tl;dr: Lower weight molecules hydrate deep below the skin, while higher weight ones hydrate closer to the surface). The silky texture absorbs into the skin immediately. However, I do think you can find great <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/g28264546/best-hyaluronic-acid-serum-benefits/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hyaluronic acid serums" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">hyaluronic acid serums</a> at lower price points.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Vitamin C8 Serum ($90):</strong> I applied this in the morning, and it left my complexion super glowy. It felt more watery than other vitamin C serums and felt tingly on my skin, but not to the point of being uncomfortable.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Face Cream ($85):</strong> During my facial with Czech, she told me this was her and Kardashian’s favorite product to formulate. The moisturizer has an airy yet hydrating texture that’s composed of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/a39715081/what-is-squalane/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=squalane class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">squalane</a>, shea butter, and a retinol alternative. I use retinol a few times a week, and when used with the cream, I didn’t have irritation (a win in my book).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Eye Cream ($75):</strong> I am picky about eye creams; in my experience, they either don’t layer well under makeup or just sit on my skin. The cream (dosed with peptides) melted into my skin and worked perfectly under concealer. I typically reach for brightening eye creams, but I like this one for nighttime, or days when dark circles aren’t a concern.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Oil Drops ($95):</strong> This oil contains vitamin C, so it leaves a nice glow, plus squalane to moisturize. A little goes a long way with this oil, but I like it for times when I need a boost of hydration and radiance (so—always).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Night Oil ($95): </strong>To me, a nighttime oil feels super luxurious. I slathered this formula, which is filled with 14 oils—from sweet almond to argan—on my face, neck, and chest, and it helped lock in the moisture from the face cream. The formula also felt lightweight, so I didn’t feel greasy going to bed.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Final Rating: 3.5</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While the line has some nice products with buzzy ingredients, plus very aesthetically pleasing packaging, it is a bit pricey compared to similar options currently on the market. However, if you're a Kim K fan and skincare junkie, it's worth testing out a few of the products.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">SKKN BY KIM is available to shop now online a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://skknbykim.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=skknbykim.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">skknbykim.com</a>.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqyjmaN6pK3RnmaabGBohXqCmHJmrKObo3qjxYykoKZloprDqrHWaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
