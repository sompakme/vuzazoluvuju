In Avengers: Infinity War, Thor said he was 1500 years old (ref: https://movieweb.com/thor-age-avengers-infinity-war/). If Loki isn't even 1100, then <b>Thor is definitely physically older</b>.</span></span><h2>How much older than Loki is Thor?</h2>You might be wondering, is Thor Older than Loki; What kind of relationship do they have in the Marvel universe; Well, these along with some other questions I'm going to answer today. Thor is 1500 years old and Loki is 1000 years old. Thor is 500 years older thank Loki.<h2>Who is older Thor or Loki in Marvel?</h2>Therefore, considering Loki 1054 years old in 2018, he must have been born in 964 AD. That's being said, the discrepancy might lie in Thor and Loki's childhood. Now, we can conclude that Loki is around 446 years Younger than Thor.<h2>Are Loki and Thor the same age in the MCU?</h2>Which is on 965 A.D. In Thor, Loki and Thor look about the same age. In Ragnarok, Thor confirms they were about the same age (8) when Loki stabbed him. So they are at least separated by 13 months.<h2>Is Thor the older brother of Loki?</h2>Description: Loki was the current Prince of Asgard and former king, he is the son of Laufey, adoptive son of the late Odin and Frigga, adoptive younger brother to Hela and Thor.<h2>How Old are Thor and Loki in the MCU and Comics?</h2><p></p><h2>Does Loki love Thor?</h2>Thor loves Loki and wished for him to return home so they could be a family again. However, he has become increasingly agitated with Loki, losing hope that he could be redeemed after he continues to try and subjugate innocent people.<h2>Who is Thor's BFF?</h2>As Heimdall was Thor's best friend, the Asgardian King took his death the hardest out of the deaths of the Asgardians, surpassed only by the grief he felt for Loki, who died soon after Heimdall.<h2>Is Loki 16 in human years?</h2>Thor and Loki's ages relative to human years were worked out with Thor 23 years old and Loki just 16 years old!<h2>How old is Thor in human years?</h2>Although he is 1500 years old, Thor is comparatively young for an Asgardian; his age equates to about 22 in human years. That makes him older than a young adult but much younger than middle-aged.<h2>Who is older Thor or Thanos?</h2>Thor is older than Thanos.<h2>What is Loki's age?</h2>Superhuman Longevity: Like all Frost Giants, Loki aged far slower than humans. Despite being over 1,000 years old, he still maintains the physical appearance of a man in his prime. In Avengers: Infinity War, when Loki was killed by Thanos, he was 1,054 years old.<h2>Is Thor or Loki stronger?</h2>Loki and Thor are both gods and have immense godly powers that make them somewhat impervious to harm, though they can be beaten; they can lose eyes (Thor) and they can die (Loki). If the metric is physical strength, then Thor is easily the winner.<h2>How old is Thor in Endgame?</h2>Even though he may not always act it, the granddaddy of them all is Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who stated in Avengers: Infinity War that he was roughly 1,500 years old. That would make him roughly 1,505 during the events of Endgame.<h2>Who is the strongest Avenger?</h2>1 Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff<p>That was enough to consider her near the top but Wanda Maximoff, known as Scarlet Witch, is the officially most powerful Avenger now.</p><h2>Why is Loki so small for a frost giant?</h2>It's a combination of his natural appearance, along with Odin's interference. He was naturally born smaller than regular Frost Giants. When Odin found him, he cast a spell on him to change his appearance to that of an Asgardian (there was a short flashback scene showing this in the film).<h2>What is the lifespan of an Asgardian?</h2>Asgardians' regenerative abilities enable them to have longer lifespans. While humans generally perceive them as immortal, Odin has pointed out they are not. Loki noted that, even though they are not truly immortal, Asgardians live much longer, "give or take 5,000 years".<h2>How old is Loki in asgardian years?</h2>Asgardians live for about 5,000 years and Loki's only been around for 1,070 of those years, which, relative to humans, makes him about 21.4 years old. Thor, on the other hand, is 1,500 years old, which makes him about 30 years old in human years.<h2>Does Loki turn into a woman?</h2>In the comics, Loki is reborn as a woman, known simply as Lady Loki, after the events of Ragnarok in Asgard, but even that wasn't too innocent: When Thor and his fellow Asgardians are to be reborn in new bodies on Earth, Loki actually stole the body intended to be for Sif.<h2>How old is Groot?</h2>In Guardians of the Galaxy: 25 years old, 1 years old at the end. In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: 5 years old, 18 in a mid-credits scene. In Avengers: Infinity War: 18 years old.<h2>How long is a year on Asgard?</h2>In Thor, when speaking to Odin, he clarifies that they are not gods, nor immortal, to which Loki responds "Give or take 5,000 years". If we do some math and say 5,000 is the average life expectancy of a typical Asgardian, and divide that by 80 years here on earth, we get 62.5.<h2>How old is Asgard Marvel?</h2>Asgard first appeared in Journey into Mystery #85 (Oct. 1962) by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby, and features prominently in stories that follow the Marvel Comics superhero Thor, who appeared two issues earlier.<h2>How old is Odin Thor Ragnarok?</h2>In Thor: The Dark World, Odin makes it clear that they “are born, they live, they die, just as humans do”, to which Loki replies that “give or take, 5000 years” – so taking that into account, Odin was at least 5000 years old when he died in Ragnarok.<h2>Who is Thor closest to?</h2><p>Marvel: Thor's Closest Allies</p><li>1 Jane Foster. One of the first humans Thor came in contact with when he was banished to the realm of Earth, Jane Foster has often helped ground him.</li><li>2 Captain America. ...</li><li>3 Beta Ray Bill. ...</li><li>4 Balder The Brave. ...</li><li>5 She-Hulk. ...</li><li>6 Frigga. ...</li><li>7 Iron Man. ...</li><li>8 Lady Sif. ...</li><h2>Who is Thors wife?</h2>Sif is introduced in chapter three of the Prologue section of the Prose Edda; Snorri's euhemerized account of the origins of Viking mythology.
