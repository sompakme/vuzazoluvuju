Per his <a href=#>LinkedIn</a>, Brooks, an alumna of Brown University and Harvard, has a career spanning three decades. After working as an associate at Apax Partners for two years, Brooks served as Vice President of New Century Holdings between 1994 and 1999. As listed, his next big role came in 1999 when he became a Managing Partner at&nbsp;<a href=#>ABRY Partners,</a> a private equity company based out of Boston. There, he led the creation and sale of several IT companies, accruing to a reported valuation of about&nbsp;$11 billion. Brooks reportedly also managed all investment professionals at the firm and was a key figure in the company's&nbsp;$17 billion raise.</p><p>After 20 years with the firm, Brooks went on to establish his own company in 2019, Ethos Capital, where he serves as CEO. As described on its <a href=#>website</a>, Ethos Capital is an investment firm seeking to help companies accelerate their growth through the use of edge-cutting technology. Though Ethos Capital has been in the game for only four years, the firm has racked up an impressive portfolio boasting companies like Identity Digital and Newforma, which was acquired in March 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtlaoB0fo6joKWkXaKus8DIp2ShraOXrq%2BwjLCfqGWVp7asecGrpqijo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
