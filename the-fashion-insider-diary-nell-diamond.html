How does it reflect your role in the fashion industry?</strong></p><p id=ekXszEuT7VJ7 data-wc=104>My personal style is always a little bit overdressed. My friends joke that I never need to look at dress codes because I am always the most dressed-up person at the party. That sort of who I have been in my old life. I used to beg to wear life-size Barbie clothes to primary school and I’ve never really gotten rid of the habit. I tend to like bright colours or pastels in cool tones and loads of rings and earrings in complementary colours. If I’m doing a darker look, I like it to have structure. My mood really dictates the way I dress.&nbsp;</p><p id=eAw0L3Nm5FKv data-wc=20><strong>What's your go-to outfit for a busy day of fashion events and meetings? How do you balance comfort and style?</strong></p><p id=eVRtpY3FNvth data-wc=84>My recent go-to has been the Hill House Ida Slip Dress. I love that it's infinitely layerable. I’ll pop on a cropped blazer. My favorites are from Celine or Alessandra Rich and a great pair of heels, if I've got a business meeting. But I’ll also wear it with sandals and bare shoulders on holiday in March. I like my day-to-day looks to be flattering and comfortable at the same time, which is a tall order but one that Hill House has excelled in.&nbsp;</p><p id=efsxeuawEfCe data-wc=9><strong>What are your go-to brands? (other than your own!)</strong></p><p id=eCVEZt7cwV-f data-wc=66>There are so many brands that I love. I love a good Courreges mini-skirt. My ultimate designer wish list always has Prada on it. Their sheer skirts for spring are the stuff of dreams. I love New York designers like Prabal Gurung, Rosie Assoulin, Christopher John Rogers, Brandon Maxwell, Monse Maison, and my favourite Brits are Amelia Wickstead, Erdem, and for coats Shrimps and Charlotte Simone.&nbsp;</p><p id=e9TGmpRXMPok data-wc=18><strong>Do you have any fashion icons or inspirations that influence your style choices? How do they inspire you?</strong></p><p id=el_5UCFFf3g_ data-wc=51>My three-year-old daughter Willow is quickly becoming my style icon. She has very strong opinions about her looks. Her recent request has been multi-coloured butterfly hair clips, an entire pack's worth in her hair each day and Tulle dresses meant for twirling. Her current favourite is the glitter sparkle tiny Ellie.&nbsp;</p><p id=eA3hhVwGBrde data-wc=19><strong>Weekdays can be hectic. What's your weekday workwear wardrobe like, and how does it differ from your weekend attire?</strong></p><p id=etTpDtBZluh7 data-wc=68>I am fairly consistent with my wardrobe. I have never liked trousers, I am a dress girl. So every day it is some iteration of dress. Cropped cardi, blazer, or jacket. If I am chasing my kids around the playground I’ll go with a Mary Jane or ballet flat. Whereas at work I have a whole stack of heels under my desk that I trade in and out.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5b7PF0s_unD data-wc=22><strong>Accessories can make or break an outfit. What are your must-have accessories, and how do you use them to elevate your look?</strong></p><p id=enFte3oT-iPU data-wc=37>I love a good hair bow. I am very rarely without one. My favourite is our Ashley Bow. I love how the long wings/tail trail behind me. I also love hoop earrings, Jennifer Fisher makes my favourites.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1QPX_06AIro data-wc=26><strong>In the fashion world, trends are constantly evolving. How do you stay up-to-date with the latest fashion trends, and do you incorporate them into your wardrobe?</strong></p><p id=e2ieUT300_dX data-wc=73>I have always been more inspired by people I see in real life. I remember growing up walking into Topshop and Oxford Circus and just feeling so inspired by everybody shopping there and how they were styling their clothing. I found quarantine quite difficult because I didn’t see many outfits in real life, so it’s such a pleasure to watch passers-by at our office in Soho and see how they are wearing things.</p><p id=eGqqJWDyNWFV data-wc=24><strong>Many people admire the way fashion insiders put together outfits effortlessly. Can you share some of your styling tips for mixing and matching pieces?</strong></p><p id=el009KmsySWW data-wc=83>My number one rule is if it feels good, go for it. There are no fashion rights and wrongs and the most important thing is that you love something. For mixing prints, I think it works best if the prints are of different scales, one small scale, one larger scale. So that the mismatch looks intentional. A good runway into mixing prints is to start with a stripe or a check and a print and to work your way up to two florals.&nbsp;</p><p id=er4d1nzzsaUV data-wc=18><strong>Fashion insiders often attend high-profile events and parties. What's your strategy for creating memorable looks for evening parties?</strong></p><p id=e11e1qrNwk-C data-wc=67>Comfort is key. Especially if there’s dancing involved, so I am never without a platform heel at night. They’re so much more comfortable and I love the extra height. For nighttime, I always say just add glitter. My favourite way to do it is on my eyelids. I use Urban Decay liquid glitter eyeliner on my lids and it instantly transforms my look from day to night.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue8WaqqGhn6N6tb7Ep5usZ2Vmg3GAk2idmquYnryvecinqqKclad6r7HLpWSdoZGivK%2Bwjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
