There's no denying that Everyone smiles when they look at you! Especially True she is so proud to call you hers. Tatum, You have changed mine and True's lives forever. We both needed you. I knew she would be a fantastic, loving older sister, but I don't think I ever could've imagined the love and bond you guys already have.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d5168cae44e1-khloe-kardashian-first-photo-son.jpg><p id=eOuYXocADJ data-wc=47>"You both remind me so much of uncle Bob and I.

"Ohhhh he's Rob's twin," replied one. A second said: "Wow that’s Rob's twin right there." A third added: "Oh my goodness!!! So precious and low-key resembles his Uncle Rob."</p><p id=eCLvaxn_Mk data-wc=31>Khloé and Tristan welcomed their second child via surrogate on July 28.
