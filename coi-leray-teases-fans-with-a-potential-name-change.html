He even mentioned Coi by name in the verse, joking that he wouldn't be able to score a feature from her anymore. Though her father hit back repeatedly Coi mainly tried to avoid the beef entirely and take the high road.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Now she's working on some artistic changes following a shift to Island Records earlier this year. She dropped her debut single on the new label "Wanna Come Thru" back in January. But she could be going forward in her career with a different name, albeit just a shortened one. She took to X, formerly Twitter, to muse on the idea earlier this week. "I want to remove “LERAY” from my name and just be COI :)" she posted. In the comments, fans debate whether her name is better with or without the Leray. Some point out that she already named her new album that dropped last year COI. Others think the name is perfect for the cuter side of her demeanor. Check out all the opinions fans expressed below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-coi-leray-considers-going-by-just-coi>Coi Leray Considers Going By Just "Coi"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Over the weekend, Coi Leray took the stage for a performance at Coachella. While there she debuted a few new songs for fans while also unpacking some of her biggest hits. She performed "Blick Blick," "Players," and her Anne-Marie and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>David Guetta</a> collaboration "Baby Don't Hurt Me."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Coi also popped up on another collaboration recently. She teamed up with Kaliii to contribute guest verses <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">to the G-Easy song "Femme Fatale"</a> which dropped earlier this month. The song has already racked up nearly 2 million streams in just a few weeks. What do you think of Coi Leray dropping her middle name and just going by "Coi?" Do you think it would make her harder to identify?
