I won’t give up because I’m telling the truth.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The footage also includes Daniels reacting in real time to discovering her celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti was stealing from her book proceeds. “Michael Avenatti betrayed me in every way,” she declares. “You’re in prison, bitch!”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The project,&nbsp;Stormy, is directed and produced by Emmy nominee Sarah Gibson (Orgasm Inc: The Story of OneTaste) and executive produced by Erin Lee Carr (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Britney vs Spears</a>), along with&nbsp;<a href=#>Judd Apatow</a>, Sara Bernstein and Meredith&nbsp;Kaulfers.
