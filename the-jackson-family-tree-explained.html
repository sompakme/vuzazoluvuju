Almost a year later, in 1951, the Jacksons' second child and first son, Jackie, was born. Their son Tito was born in 1952. About a year later, another son, Jermaine, was born. On Rebbie's sixth birthday, her first sister La Toya was born, in 1956. Following that birth came twin boys Marlon and Brandon in 1957, though Brandon died at birth. About a year and a half later Michael was born, in 1958. A few years later came Randy in 1961. A substantial time period would pass by before the couple had another child. Some five years later, their last child was their third daughter, Janet, who was born in 1966.</p><p dir=ltr>Though nine survived, the Jacksons had a total of 10 children together. Out of all of their children, the only one who didn't really have much of a spotlight was the eldest, Rebbie. She did, however, have some acting credits (via&nbsp;<a href=#>IMDb</a>) and recorded three albums (via <a href=#>Discogs</a>). Her younger siblings went on to garner names for themselves. First it was the boys with the formation of The Jackson 5, Michael going on to become the King of Pop, Randy also joining the band after Michael's departure, Janet starting out as a child star and eventually having her own successful music career, and La Toya also having a singing career as well as posing for Playboy magazine, per <a href=#>The Chicago Tribune</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDkHFqbmtfqbWmecmamqSrn6N6p63MoqOyZaSnsqZ5xLGnpZmZo7Klew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
