In his new book,&nbsp;The Making of a King: King Charles III and the Modern Monarchy, royal biographer Robert Hardman explained that the Cambridges aren't big fans of the award-winning program even though it seemed to capture the hearts of much of the world.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The prince … rolls his eyes when people say that ‘it’s just drama,’” a source close to William told Hardman. “Yet, he will not give it any greater publicity by complaining. He doesn’t like the idea of being seen as a complainer all the time.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The author also gave some insight into what William&nbsp;does&nbsp;watch when he has a spare minute away from things like royal engagements and juggling his patronages.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Superhero movies are, apparently, a particular favorite, especially&nbsp;Deadpool&nbsp;and all things Batman-related,” Hardman added, according to the&nbsp;Daily Mail.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He just likes action flicks," William's friend elaborated.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Samir Hussein/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">William's brother, Prince Harry, has also shared his thoughts on the show. During an&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>interview with James Corden in 2021</a>, he explained that he doesn't take anything as a reflection of reality. Instead, he said that he knows it's supposed to be an exaggerated version of what went down behind the gilded gates of Buckingham Palace.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“They don't pretend to be news. It's fiction. But it's loosely based on the truth. Of course, it's not strictly accurate," he told Corden. "It gives you a rough idea about what that lifestyle, what the pressures of putting duty and service above family and everything else, what can come from that. I'm way more comfortable with&nbsp;The Crown&nbsp;than I am seeing the stories written about my family, or my wife, or myself. That is obviously fiction — take it how you will. But this is being reported on as fact because you're supposedly news. I have a real issue with that."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570aiwmqRdl7aws9Gap6GdomK%2FsK7Eq6tmoJGnsa6tzWanq6GemLJuw8ilo6KZnWLBqbGMnKmor55ihXV%2Fj3FnbQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
