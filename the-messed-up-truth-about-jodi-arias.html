Per <a href=#>The Caylee&nbsp;Daily</a>, that was the day Travis Alexander was murdered in his own home. The killer had been horrifyingly thorough, as&nbsp;the body had no fewer than 29 stab wounds. Alexander's throat had also been slit, and there was a gunshot wound in his head. Other sources like <a href=#>ABC News</a>&nbsp;talk about "at least 27" wounds, but regardless of the exact number, the scene was still incredibly nasty.&nbsp;Per the<a href=#>&nbsp;Huffington Post</a>,&nbsp;the stab wounds were deep, and the throat wound "nearly decapitated" Alexander.&nbsp;What's worse, the man's death had been far from instant, as he had several defensive wounds. The&nbsp;<a href=#>Huffington Post</a> also mentions a massive amount of blood on the walls, floors, and sink of the bathroom where he died of blood loss.&nbsp;</p><p>Alexander's body was found in the shower of his house several days after the crime, at which point it was too decomposed to determine whether the bullet wound was post-mortem or not. The prime suspect, on the other hand, was significantly easier to determine.&nbsp;It didn't take long for the people who knew Alexander and Arias to figure out who the most likely culprit was. Per <a href=#>KPHO</a>, a co-worker stated that immediately after learning the news, she said: "It's Jodi." The authorities agreed, and Arias was arrested on&nbsp;July 15.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Fkmtqb21fqbWmecyeqqydlGLCsXnTq6ytoF2Wr7DB02ahqJyZYq6ztcCsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
