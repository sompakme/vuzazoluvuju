But then I think we both decided too, when the time of divorce came, that we had to maintain a certain amount of civility because of the children.</p><p>“I know Michael has said since being an adult that he was always very grateful that we never did badmouth each other. Sometimes we probably wanted to. And also, I think that after [Kirk] got married to Anne, [she] made it very much easier, because she and I cooperated very much in terms of bedtimes and what they could watch on television and that kind of thing.”</p><p>Reflecting on&nbsp;her marriage to the mercurial Douglas proved “useful” during the making of&nbsp;It Runs in the Family,&nbsp;she noted, “particularly the scene where we were dancing together. I think there were all sorts of things that we could call on. Actors are always looking for intense memories to call on.”</p><p>Years earlier, Douglas called on her to appear opposite him in The Indian Fighter (1955), the first film made by his production company, <span data-scayt_word=Bryna data-scaytid=7>Bryna</span>.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Born <strong>Diana Love Dill</strong> in Devonshire, Bermuda, where her father was the attorney general of the British territory (her family roots there reached back to the 1640s),&nbsp;she moved to New York and met Kirk while they were studying acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.</p><p>Chaperoned by her sister, <strong>Ruth</strong>, she headed to California after&nbsp;signing&nbsp;a contract for $200 a week with Warner Bros.
