Size Matters (But Not Always)</strong></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:290><span>Let's be honest,</span><span> Unicode is a bit of a storage hog.</span><span> All those fancy characters take up a lot of space,</span><span> which can be a pain point for things like limited bandwidth connections.</span><span> Imagine trying to download a text-based adventure game in Unicode – you'd be staring at that progress bar for days.</span><span> ASCII,</span><span> on the other hand,</span><span> is like a minimalist on a budget.</span><span> It keeps things lean and mean,</span><span> making it perfect for those situations where every byte counts.</span></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:65><strong>2. Simplicity is Beautiful (Especially When You're Debugging)</strong></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:359><span>Ever stared at a line of code riddled with weird symbols and questioned your entire career path?</span><span> That's the joy (or lack thereof) of Unicode encoding issues.</span><span> ASCII,</span><span> bless its little heart,</span><span> is about as straightforward as a brick.</span><span> You know exactly what you're getting,</span><span> and debugging becomes a walk in the park (or a stroll through a very basic,</span><span> text-only park).</span></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:37><strong>3. The OG of Emoticons ¯_(ツ)_/¯</strong></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:350><span>Okay,</span><span> this one's a bit of a stretch,</span><span> but hear me out.</span><span> ASCII art might seem primitive compared to today's emojis,</span><span> but it has a certain charm.</span><span> Remember those awesome dragon fight scenes you created with keyboard symbols?</span><span> Or the truly terrifying box ghosts that haunted your chatrooms?</span><span> ASCII art may not be fancy,</span><span> but it lets your imagination run wild.</span></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:6><strong>4.
