Furthermore, she is in a compromising pose which reveals a tattoo with the album name on it. Overall, this became a viral image on social media. Furthermore, it led to a debate about whether or not the album cover was in good taste. After all, these kinds of images can certainly make fans a bit uneasy if they aren't used to it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The project will be dropping on April 26th, and PartyNextDoor is certainly using this as an opportunity to promote his new body of work. For instance, he revealed that the P4 vinyl version is currently available for pre-order. Some fans were curious as to whether or not the album cover was simply an April Fool's prank. However, we know it wasn't because in the vinyl promo from April 2nd, Party revealed that his NSFW album art will, indeed, be the vinyl cover as well.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-partynextdoor-to-drop-soon>PartyNextDoor To Drop Soon</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This is definitely a smart move for the artist. Although some may not want to own this album art, there are plenty of others who do. Not to mention, there is a certain novelty factor to it that plays a role. Also, if you already have a collection of Party vinyls, you kind of have to go out and get this one. Only time will tell if the album is just as raunchy as the cover itself.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of PartyNextDoor and his new album cover, in the comments section down below.
