It discusses the 'myth' that women can only be accepted within society if they are beautiful, and how shifting and increasingly unrealistic these standards of beauty have become over time. Her words are more prescient than ever, particularly when we consider that they were penned before the dawn of social media and the constant barrage of unattainable images of female attractiveness.</p><span class="css-pt9i6h e16kmapv2">3</span><h2 class="css-1244ma5 e16kmapv5">'Bad Feminist' by Roxane Gay</h2><img alt="best feminist books" data-cy=slide-image-3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/roxane-gay-bad-feminist-1616676236.jpg title="Best feminist books" width=400 height=600 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.waterstones.com/book/bad-feminist/roxane-gay/9781472119735 data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SHOP NOW" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-80pdur emevuu60">SHOP NOW</a></p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bad Feminist is a collection of wry essays that looks at what it means to be a modern feminist while enjoying things that might seem at odds with it, whether that be following fashion or wanting children. This reassuring, funny and wise book discusses how the culture we consume becomes who we are, and offers ways in which we can all do better.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-pt9i6h e16kmapv2">4</span><h2 class="css-1244ma5 e16kmapv5">'Your Silence Will Not Protect You' by Audre Lorde</h2><img alt="audre lorde" data-cy=slide-image-4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lorde-648c2a0fb69b4.jpeg title="audre lorde" width=1678 height=2560 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">courtesy Silver Press</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.waterstones.com/book/your-silence-will-not-protect-you/reni-eddo-lodge/audre-lorde/9780995716223 data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SHOP NOW" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-80pdur emevuu60">SHOP NOW</a></p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Audre Lorde is one of the 20th century's most inspiring and powerful scribes. Your Silence Will Not Protect You is a must-have collection of her essays, prose and poetry, which skewers and dissects the realities of womanhood and, in particular, Black womanhood. Her words are breathtaking and this collection is a pivotal starting point when approaching intersectional feminism.</p><span class="css-pt9i6h e16kmapv2">5</span><h2 class="css-1244ma5 e16kmapv5">'My Life On The Road' by Gloria Steinem</h2><img alt="best feminist books" data-cy=slide-image-5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gloria-steinem-life-on-the-road-1616676316.jpg title="Best feminist books" width=1557 height=2336 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.waterstones.com/book/my-life-on-the-road/gloria-steinem/9781780749204 data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SHOP NOW" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-80pdur emevuu60">SHOP NOW</a></p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gloria Steinem has always been on the move. Ever since she was young, her father would pack the family into the car, to go off on a new adventure. Although such an early nomadic existence came with its challenges, it did prepare Steinem for a life on the road as she became an instrumental part of the women's rights movement and a tireless campaigner. This engaging and warm memoir is about that journey and how she'll never give up fighting for her causes.</p><span class="css-pt9i6h e16kmapv2">6</span><h2 class="css-1244ma5 e16kmapv5">'The Second Sex' by Simone de Beauvoir</h2><img alt="the second sex" data-cy=slide-image-6 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-second-sex-648c2842efbfc.jpeg title="the second sex" width=1400 height=2149 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">courtesy Vintage publishing</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-second-sex/simone-de-beauvoir/constance-borde/9780099595731 data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SHOP NOW" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-80pdur emevuu60">SHOP NOW</a></p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A foundational feminist text, de Beauvoir's groundbreaking treatise on the state of womanhood is essential reading. Originally published in 1949, it featured a vastly researched history of the treatment of women and their current status in society. It was banned by the Vatican at the time and went on to become the inspiration for Second Wave Feminism that would dominate the Women's Movement of the 1960s and 1970s.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-pt9i6h e16kmapv2">7</span><h2 class="css-1244ma5 e16kmapv5">'Invisible Women' by Caroline Criado Perez</h2><img alt="best feminist books" data-cy=slide-image-7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/caroline-criado-perez-invisible-women-1616676319.jpg title="Best feminist books" width=1524 height=2286 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.waterstones.com/book/invisible-women/caroline-criado-perez/9781784706289 data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SHOP NOW" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-80pdur emevuu60">SHOP NOW</a></p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If ever you need to provide evidential proof that gender inequality still rages to a backward-thinking relative, then show them Caroline Criado Perez's exhaustively researched book immediately. It focuses on the shocking gender bias that affects all women, highlighting the many ways that society has forgotten women and the impact that this has on our health and wellbeing. Invisible Women is data-based number-crunching at its most persuasive, and an important tool for change.</p><span class="css-pt9i6h e16kmapv2">8</span><h2 class="css-1244ma5 e16kmapv5">'Fat is a Feminist Issue' by Susie Orbach</h2><img alt="susie orbach" data-cy=slide-image-8 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fat-is-a-feminist-issue-648c29a890071.jpeg title="susie orbach" width=1524 height=2339 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">courtesy Penguin Random House</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.waterstones.com/book/fat-is-a-feminist-issue/susie-orbach/9781784753092 data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SHOP NOW" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-80pdur emevuu60">SHOP NOW</a></p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's hard to believe that this book was first published in 1978; its messaging about the politicisation of female bodies and, in particular, 'fat' female bodies, feels incredibly fresh. Back then it was a pioneering work that took aim at the diet industry and how the size of a woman's body is about much more than food, but instead represents power, strength and politics. The most recent edition, published in 2016, includes an updated introduction from Orbach, which looks at how these issues have shifted in our digital age.</p><span class="css-pt9i6h e16kmapv2">9</span><h2 class="css-1244ma5 e16kmapv5">'Hood Feminism' by Mikki Kendall</h2><img alt="hood feminism" data-cy=slide-image-9 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hood-feminism-648c2a8d9e707.jpeg title="hood feminism" width=1575 height=2560 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">courtesy Penguin Random House</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.waterstones.com/book/hood-feminism/mikki-kendall/9781526622709 data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SHOP NOW" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-80pdur emevuu60">SHOP NOW</a></p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hood Feminism was published just two years ago, and has already become a significant addition to the feminist canon. This is meaningful precisely because Mikki Kendall's focus is on how the feminist movement has too often left behind Black women, trans women and women from lower socio-economic backgrounds. It is a masterpiece of intersectional feminist writing that looks at how we fight for power and what that means if we forget those who need it most.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-pt9i6h e16kmapv2">10</span><h2 class="css-1244ma5 e16kmapv5">'Men Explain Things to Me' by Rebecca Solnit</h2><img alt="men explain things to me" data-cy=slide-image-10 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/men-explain-things-to-me-648c2b6ccddc5.png title="men explain things to me" width=345 height=497 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">courtesy Haymarket Books</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.waterstones.com/book/men-explain-things-to-me/rebecca-solnit/9781642590982 data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SHOP NOW" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-80pdur emevuu60">SHOP NOW</a></p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Short yet punchy, this book is a must-read. Rebecca Solnit is a master of impactful, witty prose and has penned a compelling narrative here on the realties of mansplaining (she was somewhat responsible for coining the phrase), which goes far beyond the patronising intonations and assumption of men, to the belittling of female experience and capability globally. This is a gift of a text on the rarely discussed subtleties of everyday sexism.</p><p><h6 class="css-1qmam5g e1a8voem2"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-0 e1a8voem1">Watch Next</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h6 class="css-oh7euc e1a8voem0">&nbsp;</h6></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Featured Videos from Harpers Bazaar UK" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/maxresdefault-1-63fe26bb0578b.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWTAta3YoqWgZZmjfKh%2FlHJqbmxjZ3ynscyipaKrpGKvsLvKrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
