Overall, he has become a massive star thanks to numerous incredible albums and songs. From Days Before Rodeo to Astroworld, Scott has continued to push hip-hop forward. He has a very unique sound, and it never fails to impress. Moreover, after Astroworld and its massive success, there was this feeling that Travis would try to follow it up quickly. However, the exact opposite ended up happening. Instead, it has been almost five years since Scott has released a full-length album.</p><p>Throughout 2023, there have been plenty of rumors involving the new Travis Scott album. <a href=# rel>Utopia has been teased for years,</a> and details have slowly hit the internet. For instance, an executive at <a href=# rel>Epic Records made the claim that Travis would be dropping in June</a> of this year. Although that has yet to be officially confirmed, this serves as good news for fans of the artist. Now, however, Travis has become the latest artist to be plagued by the leak machine.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Travis Scott Tosses Fan $5K</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-scott-fans-want-a-new-album>Travis Scott Fans Want A New Album</h2></span><p>Travis Scott performs at Hayarkon Park on March 14, 2023 in Tel Aviv, Israel.

Overall, these leaks include regular tracks, old songs, and even some features. The main leak seems to be a song called "Gold Blackberry." Within the Reddit post, it reveals that Utopia could actually be coming out on June 30th. However, this is not confirmed whatsoever. Furthermore, other leaks include a 2015 song called "Poet Paradise," as well as a <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kid Cudi</a> song called "Get Off Me." At this point, it remains to be seen where all these leaks are coming from.</p><p>In the past, we have seen artists like <a href=# class=text-word rel>Playboi Carti</a> delay entire albums due to leaks. Moving forward, it will be interesting to see if Scott decides to follow suit on that. Hopefully, Scott is still able to release Utopia, as the hype is astronomical right about now.
