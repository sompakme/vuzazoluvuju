The beauty of acting is that you can go from playing a certain type of character to something completely different.&nbsp;<a href=#>Greenfield did just that and starred in several shows following "New Girl"</a>&nbsp;(via&nbsp;<a href=#>IMDb</a>).</p><p>Before "New Girl," Greenfield starred in the show "Veronica Mars" as the character Leo D'Amato. When the show made a return to television, Greenfield reprised his role (via IMDb). Greenfield told&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a>&nbsp;he was excited about reprising his role and shared that he thought it was "the perfect job right now." The actor was in this role for a year after "New Girl" finished and then tackled several other projects. Some of these included "A Series of Unfortunate Events," "American Horror Story," and the film, "Promising Young Woman."</p><p>IMDb reports that Greenfield also jumped into another project after "New Girl" wrapped and joined the sitcom, "The Neighborhood." In 2019, Greenfield talked to&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a>&nbsp;about joining the cast and the show's renewal for a second season. He shared, "The entire writing staff, they do such an amazing job, and for me, I'm just excited to see where they take it." Greenfield hoped that the show would only continue to succeed, and his wish has been granted; "The Neighborhood" has had an incredible five seasons so far. As much as Greenfield enjoys acting, he also took on different projects.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamliZ4F1g46wn5qsXaKuuXnGq5yeppaesq2wjKGYrGWSmrKvedSpZK2nXai2r6%2FEZqWer12ctrO4jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
