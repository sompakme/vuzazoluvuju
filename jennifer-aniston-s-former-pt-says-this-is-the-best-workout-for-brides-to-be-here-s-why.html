We’ve loved her ever since she graced our screens as Rachel on Friends (and even more so since she joined the rest of the cast to announce a <a class=hm-link href=#>reunion episode</a>), and we’re big fans of all the tips and tricks she shares on how she stays in shape. At 51, Jennifer Aniston looks just as good – if not better – now than she did 30 years ago, and from <a class=hm-link href=#>regular boxing</a> to<a class=hm-link href=#> intermittent fasting,</a> she tells us all there is to know. Her latest workout habit goes by the name of Lagree, a form of Megaformer Pilates (Pilates on a spring-based resistance board), and according to its founder and Jen’s former personal trainer, it’s ideal for brides-to-be.</p><p id=e3-Q_-gAc4V9J data-wc=1><strong>SEE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Jennifer Aniston reveals what happens before a red carpet event</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/176046a52bc2-jennifer-aniston-fitness-a.jpg><p id=e0BVktxmpdBvw data-wc=9><strong>Jennifer Aniston at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, 2020</strong></p><p id=e40xoWparwOqk data-wc=105>“Lagree equals fast results,” Sebastian Lagree told us. “Each movement on the Megaformer is fully integrated meaning that we never isolate a muscle in a particular movement and because of it, the body gets stronger and all muscles get toned within each session.” Every Megaformer move incorporates more than one muscle since you are forced to balance and control at the same time. The result is an effective all-over workout, which Sebastian says often garners results within two weeks (and Meghan Markle previously confirmed during an interview with Harper’s Bazaar in which she claims to have seen a change in her body after two classes).</p><p id=exMKtnau4CDzG data-wc=1><strong>SEE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Jennifer Aniston shares a peek inside her luxurious bathroom</a></strong></p><p id=eY8qdU_oenHMr data-wc=40>Sebastian adds: “Many people have even noticed a difference after the first workout, but here is the warning: Lagree is an intense workout. Some refer to it as Pilates and that’s a mistake, because Pilates is not intense at all.”</p><p id=e1H5MSGdDZ_sO data-wc=24>For brides-to-be, this means you won’t need to sacrifice as much <a class=hm-link href=#>wedding planning</a> time - just stick to a regular routine once you pick it up.</p><p id=eUNH7so-uMUhn data-wc=30>If that’s not enough to convince you, Sebastian also cites <a class=hm-link href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, <a class=hm-link href=#>Chrissy Teigen</a>, <a class=hm-link href=#>Michelle Obama</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Rihanna</a> as Lagree clients, while there are now three&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Lagree studios</a> to visit across London.
