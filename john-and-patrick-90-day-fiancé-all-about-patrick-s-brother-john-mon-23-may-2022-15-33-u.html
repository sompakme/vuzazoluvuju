The two live together, but why? After divorcing from his ex-wife, Patrick was left alone in a “big house” having to “start all over again.” This led to him asking his brother to move in with him, and they have been living together for the last three years.</p><p>The two brothers work together as Patrick sells home security alarms and manages sales teams throughout Texas. Meanwhile, John is the person who installs them.</p><p>John does not have a particularly large social media presence. His brother, Patrick, boasts 20.3 thousand followers on his Instagram account @buffmendes. The account follows a page called @johnny_from_90_day_fiance, which we can assume to be John’s social media page.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-has-john-said-about-thais>What has John said about Thais?</h2><p>In one clip, John invites over his friends who are loud whilst Patrick in on a video call with Thais. Upset by all the yelling in the house, Thais can be seen asking Patrick why they had to live with John, to which he responds “he’s my brother.”</p><p>Thais brands John “annoying” and explains that they need their freedom as a couple. However, Patrick tells her: “My love, we’re going to try, ok?”</p><p>John also can be seen questioning how things will be when Thais moves in, and explains that he “cherishes” his brother and the relationship he has with him. He states that Thais moving in will be a “test,” as they all have big egos. He ends by questioning: “Blood’s thicker than water, right?”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Thais 90 day fiancé (@thaisramoniee)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=i-think-john-is-jealous-of-thais>“I think John is jealous of Thais”</h2><p>Fans of the show have taken to Twitter to discuss John’s behaviour on the show.
