It dries quickly and the finished product looks matte, making it perfect for makeup application or for adding more layers of skincare (like sunscreen during the day or facial oil at night). But just because it’s light, doesn’t mean it’s not hydrating: This formula is packed with hyaluronic acid and with Pentavitin, Dr. Jart+’s trademark ingredient that promises to fortify the skin barrier so that you can hold onto all of that hydration.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-venn><span>Venn</span></h2><p>In less than 10 years, Venn has developed a devoted cult following.

Safe to use on both the face and neck, it uses peptides to deeply hydrate and Ginsenoside Compound K to firm and brighten.

Dry skin? Irritated skin? Allow us to introduce you to this super rich, super soothing cica-powered moisturizer. It helps strengthen your skin barrier, reduce dryness, and leave your complexion with a gorgeous glow. It is on the thicker side, though, so you may want to save it for your nighttime skincare routine.

These affordable options by Meebak come in packs of three, with 18 patches per sheet—a fabulous value. Plus, they not only triage pimples but cover them up, so you can wear your patches all day and all night without anyone knowing you’re wearing them. They’re infused with cica and centellla asiatica, which go a long way in diminishing the appearance of zits while nourishing skin so it doesn’t scar.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-peach-slices><span>Peach Slices</span></h2><p>Chances are you’ve seen the brand’s “Snail Rescue” line go viral on TikTok.

Generally speaking, we love our chemical peels, our retinoids, and our exfoliating acids. Korean skincare, on the other hand, is more focused on long-term skin health and a well-maintained barrier. "There's a deep focus on aspects that keep skin thriving—hydration, calming, and protecting ingredients," says Yoon.</p><p>Korea is the birthplace of the double cleanse, which combines an oil cleanser to dissolve makeup and SPF with a water-based cleanser to remove sweat and dirt. "This two-step process delivers clarified, deeply cleansed skin without being harsh on skin," adds Yoon.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/dr.zionko/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Zion Ko Lamm</a>, a board-certified Internal Medicine physician specializing in skincare, look for oil cleansers with grapeseed. Grapeseed oil is known to improve the barrier function of the skin, and it has "even more antioxidant benefits outside of just cleansing," she notes.</p><p>Cleansing is always followed by deep hydration. "Essences are a staple skincare category in Korea as they're formulated to flood skin with hydration," says Yoon. "The seven-skin method originated in Korea years ago, and focuses on hydrating skin by patting on seven layers of your essence to flood skin with hydration."</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-long-is-a-korean-skincare-routine><span>How Long Is a Korean Skincare Routine?</span></h2><p>Most people associate Korean skincare with 12-step routines. While a lengthy regimen can be the case, it doesn't have to be. "A standard routine may not always have so many steps, but because each routine is focused on personalization and ensuring skin is cleansed well, amply hydrated, with targeted treatments, and SPFS, you typically have a multi-stepped routine," notes Yoon.</p><p>In addition to a double cleanse, essence, and SPF (K-Beauty sunscreens are elite), you'll also likely include serums or ampoules that can address specific concerns. "Some people might use one serum every day of the week while others pair two serums together. Others might switch up serums several times a week to hyper-target how their skin is feeling each day," adds Yoon.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-expensive-is-korean-skincare><span>How Expensive Is Korean Skincare?</span></h2><p>Because Korea is one of the most competitive beauty landscapes with demanding consumers, brands are constantly challenged to level up formulas, packaging, and value. "We have avid skincare consumers in Korea to thank for many of the innovative, accessible, and exceptional products," notes Yoon. As a result, many products have a lower price point.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-experts><span>Meet the Experts</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y2dp5JryAyHg9jrCGzHmXL-1920-80.jpg><span class=person__name>Dr. Zion Ko Lamm</span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=LINKEDIN><span class=button-social__icon></span></a>Internal Medicine Physician<p>Dr. Zion Ko Lamm is a board-certified Internal Medicine Physician who specializes in skincare.
