On social media, Tate portrayed himself as a wealthy cigar-smoking playboy, prompting one admirer to dub him the “king of toxic masculinity.”</p><p>But Tate’s treatment of women had an ugly side. In 2016, he was <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>booted off</a> the British version of Big Brother over a video of him hitting a woman with a belt. This March, Britain’s Daily Mirror tabloid <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>profiled</a> him and his brother Tristan Tate and their Romania-based business which used webcam models to trick men into sending the brothers tens of thousands of dollars. In <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>one video</a> on his YouTube channel, Andrew Tate said “40 percent” of the reason he moved to Romania was because Romanian police were less likely to pursue sexual assault allegations.</p><p>Tate’s unsavory activities didn’t stop him from building links with the stars of the Trumpian right. In 2019, Tate <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>palled</a> around Washington, D.C. with prominent online Trump activists and conspiracy theorists. He shared a meal with far-right cable news commentator Jack Posobiec and Infowars host Paul Joseph Watson, and appeared multiple times on Infowars shows.</p><p>In Trump’s Washington hotel, Tate posed for a picture with Brexit advocate Nigel Farage, and sat in a group in the Trump hotel lobby with the likes of Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich and future Jan. 6 protest organizer <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Ali Alexander</a>. Cernovich visited the Tate brothers in Romania later that year, describing them as his “friends” in the description of his podcast.</p><p>While Cernovich built his name online by making false human-trafficking claims about a Washington pizzeria, the Tates may soon be accused of genuine human trafficking. In a statement provided to The Daily Beast, Romania’s Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism said the raid on the Tates’ house was part of an investigation that began after a woman was reported to be held at the house against her will. As the probe continued, it escalated to include “crimes of human trafficking and rape.”</p><p>On Tuesday, April 27, a spokesperson for the Romanian policy agency added that no one has been charged or arrested yet in the case, but that the investigation is ongoing.</p><p><a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Video</a> from the raid show police officers armed with rifles milling among the Tates’ sports cars, with a neon “TATE” logo on a wall in the background. Another video showed Tate and his brother being shoved into vans by police officers before being driven away from their homes.</p><p>A Romanian newspaper <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>reported</a> that the raid was sparked over reports that an American woman was being held captive at the Tate house. Police found both the American and a Romanian woman in the building during the raid, according to the report. In a statement on the raid to The Daily Beast, a U.S. State Department spokesperson alluded to a reported abduction of an American citizen but declined to comment further.</p><p>“We are aware of reports of a U.S. citizen held against their will in Romania,” the spokesperson said. “Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment."</p><p>In an interview with The Daily Beast, Tristan Tate disputed the Romanian media report that police found women in house who were there against their will.</p><p>“No girls were found in my house, and nobody was arrested,” Tate said.</p><p>Andrew Tate’s pro-Trump colleagues—Cernovich, Watson, Posobiec, and Alexander—also didn’t respond to emails from The Daily Beast.</p><p>Andrew Tate appeared to address the raid in an Instagram picture, featuring him smoking a cigar in a staged interrogation room as faux-police officers loomed over him. Tate added a caption: “Officer...l think we can all agree that bitches love to lie.”</p><p>The raid on the Tates’ villa isn’t the first time that the “manosphere,” the far-right men’s online community that Tate belongs to, has been tied to serious criminal activity. In December, a prominent manosphere personality <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>went on a killing spree</a> in Denver, murdering five people before being fatally shot by a police officer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfpbyttcKeZKuZmZl6rq3GmmSkoZ6cerCyjK2msaGTYrqiv8Kuo6KmmanGbrXNZp%2BupZGjerW%2BwJ%2BdopubnruoecinrZ6rpJ60osDIqKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
