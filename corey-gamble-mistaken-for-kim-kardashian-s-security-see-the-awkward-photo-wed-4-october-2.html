He wore matching black silk with his beau, while Kim stood out in her usual glamor in a silk pink dress. What does Corey Gamble actually do? It’s not security…</strong></p><p>He was the only male to attend <a href=#>The Kardashians</a>‘ Cabo vacation in season 4 episode 1.

Earlier this year, the star increased protection at her home in the gated community Hidden Hills, where <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> lives.</p><p>“I heard Cory is the CIA😂😂😂😂,” a fellow fan wrote. It comes after <a href=#>Kanye West</a> can be heard spewing some unconfirmed words towards Corey, whom he claims is in the “CIA” in a leaked video.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-does-corey-gamble-do>What does Corey Gamble do?</h2><p>Corey was on a Justin Bieber tour as an assistant when Kris met him.
