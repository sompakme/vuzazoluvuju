The man opened with "Euphoria," and it was clear from Ken's very first note that this was going to be a nasty double-down against his opponent. While Drake hasn't said much to indicate his thoughts on the matter (<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">though there are hints</a>), there are many fans on both sides currently speculating on what his reaction must've been like and what he did or is doing right now that could reflect that.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, one of the main factors driving these Drake theories is that Kendrick Lamar had a lot of people in attendance that were not as obviously on Team K.Dot before, but certainly look like they are now. The biggest examples of this are <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a couple of NBA players</a>. DeMar DeRozan (whom Kendrick rapped about leaving the Toronto Raptors on "Not Like Us") and Russell Westbrook took the stage to dance to the diss, and LeBron James and James Harden were in attendance. "Lebron rapping along to 'the other vaginal option' gonna send Drake into a tailspin lmaooooo," one fan wrote.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-lebron-james-at-kendrick-lamar-s-concert>LeBron James At Kendrick Lamar's Concert</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, another big factor of many of these reactions, especially from the OVO camp, is how Kendrick Lamar and the West Coast should thank Drake for this. After all, a lot of people see this success as a direct result of using The Boy's name for "clout," as bizarre as it is to say one of the biggest rappers alive someone who needs any more of that. But there's a lot of new things that Mr. Morale did in the beef's aftermath, like speaking at Compton College and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">reuniting</a> <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Black Hippy</a>, that he might not have done if he didn't have good reason to. Nevertheless, Kendrick also made it clear that this moment means much more to him than any feud, and that this is just capitalizing on one domino that fell and created momentum for much more.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-fans-theorize-drake-amp-his-fans-reactions-to-the-pop-out>Fans Theorize Drake & His Fans' Reactions To "The Pop Out"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">From what these reactions indicate, there's no telling how Drake really feels about the Kendrick Lamar show right now. Maybe he'll respond with some subliminal disses, IG Story shade, or another sort of clap-back or public address. His fans <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">reacted quite comically</a> to all this as well, in amicable and not-so-friendly ways alike. All of them are valid, though. After all, most of us don't know what it's like to have about 17,000 people diss you on repeat about eight or nine times throughout a celebration.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop.
