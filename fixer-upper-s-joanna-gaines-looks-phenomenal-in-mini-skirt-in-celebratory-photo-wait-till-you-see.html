In August, Joanna opened up her thoughts on Drake leaving home to go to college.&nbsp;</p><p id=esb40RURgL data-wc=49>Chatting to People, she said: "When [Drake] was Crew's age, people would look at me and say, 'Oh, you better hold on tight. It goes by fast. Now, being a mother of a four-year-old and an almost 18-year-old, it's a constant reminder to not take these moments for granted."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c9f7d2c9d941-1766723664722146106858476070655635277140364n.jpg><p id=eL9bpq22-5 data-wc=36>In an essay in Magnolia Journal, the quarterly lifestyle magazine she publishes with her husband, Joanna further reflected on Drake's then upcoming departure.
