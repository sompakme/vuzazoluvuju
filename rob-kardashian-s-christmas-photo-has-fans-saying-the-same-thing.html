The makeup mogul <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>originally announced</a></strong> that her second child with her <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>on-again-off-again boyfriend Travis Scott</a></strong> was named Wolf, however she <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>later took this back</a></strong> and revealed the couple were still experimenting with their son's name. In January 2023, Kylie revealed her son's name <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>was actually Aire</a></strong> just before <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>his first birthday</a></strong>.</p><p id=en7lR_PBxZH4>While Kim has not changed any of her children's names, she has revealed that she doesn't usually call her daughter Chicago by her full name. Instead, she calls the young girl 'Chi' (<strong><a class=hm-link href=#>pronounced "Shy"</a></strong>). "Chicago just looks really long to me and doesn't flow, so I call her Chi," Kim told fans in a video she posted on her website.</p><p id=eacA2ymgias data-wc=48>One person wrote: "All of them spent 364 days researching the very best print and color combo.

I love mothering people, I don't know if they like that or not but it’s in my blood just to be a mom, I wouldn’t have it any other way. I feel like I'm like a third parent for Dream.
