In a video that has gone viral, Game can be seen giving 40 Glocc a beating, an incident that later landed the Compton rapper in some trouble. Glocc later sued Game for&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">$4.54 million in 2013</a>,&nbsp;citing a variety of damages including PTSD:</p><ul><li>$500,000 for pain and suffering</li><li>$500,000 for emotional distress</li><li>$2 million in punitive damages</li><li>$25,000 in medical expenses</li><li>$750,000 for lost earnings</li></ul><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to Glocc, he was awarded a settlement of&nbsp;$196,335.15 but Game has yet to pay up. There were reported accusations that Game was purposefully avoiding <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">making the payment to Glocc</a>, and now&nbsp;The Blast&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">states</a> that the pair may be closer to putting this all behind them. According to the outlet, Glocc told a court on Friday that he and Game's lawyers are currently in settlement talks. They did have a scheduled court date today, but it's been pushed back until August so they can have time to work things out privately.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The animosity between these two has been something that's been played out for the public for years as they've traded vicious verbal insults.
