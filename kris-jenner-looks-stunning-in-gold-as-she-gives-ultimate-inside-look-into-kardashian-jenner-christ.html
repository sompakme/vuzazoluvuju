They have hosted a party on the date every year, with the exception of 2020 due to rising cases of COVID-19, and 1978.</p><p id=e9Ao1F9ceb data-wc=52>In 2019 Kris passed on the hosting duties to daughters Kim and Kourtney.

It seemed there was a gingerbread house theme to the decoration, as Kris took fans through to a snow-trimmed gingerbread cabin stocked with treats and miniature Christmas trees.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c28b6383c7d5-the-most-magical-night-of-the-year-3.jpg><p id=etoFEhRVCR data-wc=66>On the other side of the cabin, a table was stocked with decorate-your-own gingerbread houses and a ball pit full of white and gold balls, perfect for children. Meanwhile the setting was decked out with large gingerbread-looking structures to set out a baked good wonderland, with snowy Christmas trees galore, giant snowflakes hanging from the sky, and a black starry background to indicate a night sky.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ee31a4ba22fa-the-most-magical-night-of-the-year-1.jpg><p id=emPmNuWRkY data-wc=56>More generally, the theme was that of a ski-lodge, as another room within the huge party showed a large snow-covered oak tree at the center of the room, surrounded by comfy-looking white seats and wooden tables for a rustic look. Meanwhile, outside the party, the garden was decorated with realistic fake snow that trimmed fir trees.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8787b48c3ed4-the-most-magical-night-of-the-year-2.jpg><p id=eC8kN-H08P data-wc=22>As always, the Kardashian Jenner family dress to impress for the incredible event, as they posted a video revealing their iconic outfits.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6679d930f1f1-414243266185931122290606591144316033821593697n.jpg><p id=eRjAdqLAZx data-wc=49><a class=hm-link href=#>Kylie</a>, 26, sparkled in a bright gold sequined down as she wore her dark hair loose. <a class=hm-link href=#>Kendall</a> opted for old Hollywood glamour in a custom 16arlington gown; black and trimmed white bright white fur. <a class=hm-link href=#>Khloe</a> stunned in a glittering nude gown, while <a class=hm-link href=#>Kourtney</a> opted for an all-black fur gown.</p><p id=eCfrm-uBQ4 data-wc=21><a class=hm-link href=#>Kim</a> also wore a fur-trimmed gown, opting for archival Thierry Mugler for the event as she looked like an ice queen.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian take a snowy sleigh ride</figure><p id=eZX8xPb_5X data-wc=24>Later on, Kim and <a class=hm-link href=#>Paris Hilton</a> could be found sledding down a hill while <a class=hm-link href=#>Rihanna'</a>s 'Please Don't Stop The Music' blared in the background.</p><p id=e66wIJK9SM- data-wc=44>But Paris wasn't the only A-Lister to make an appearance.
