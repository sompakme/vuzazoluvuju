Moreover, with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kevin Durant</a> and Bradley Beal on his team, the Suns are expected to contend for a title. Overall, Booker has a bit of a bad reputation around the league. For some reason, a lot of fans on NBA Twitter just don't like him. Although he is a good player, there is this narrative that he is simply too overrated to be taken so seriously.</p><p>Now, however, there are some people on NBA Twitter who have changed their tone on Booker.

"Surprisingly this makes book less hated on NBA Twitter because this app full of weirdos lol but this such an L man smh I’m disappointed," said another.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-twitter-reacts>Twitter Reacts</h2></span><p>Overall, this is one of those situations that has a polarizing range of opinions.
