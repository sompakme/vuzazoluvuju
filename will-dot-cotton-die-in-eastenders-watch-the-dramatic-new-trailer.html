In dramatic scenes revealed in teaser clips, 90-year-old Dot is seen lying unconscious on her &nbsp;kitchen floor, while moments later an ambulance scene is shown with a worried looking Sonia, who is due to return in the next few weeks. After the teaser trailer was posted on YouTube, worried fans flocked to the comments section. "They can’t kill Dot,"&nbsp;one wrote, while another pleaded: "Please tell me Dot isn’t going to die."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">EastEnders: Spring Trailer - BBC One</a><p style=text-align:center id=eQZshXKodDg data-wc=17><strong>The new EastEnders trailer teases a very dramatic few months ahead for the residents of Albert Square</strong></p><p id=eQRHPw8gdp2 data-wc=97>&nbsp;Other notable moments from the preview see the return of Mick and Linda Carter, with hints of the reprise of the forbidden romance between the Queen Vic landlord and his former daughter-in-law Whitney Dean. One resident will also find themselves pregnant, with a mysterious hand holding up a positive test in dramatic footage – with many fans guessing it to be 16-year-old Bex Fowler. Denise Fox’s summer is also set to be turbulent, with the trailer showing her collapse in a classroom following her money struggles – which have resulted in her being unable to afford food.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2bd0b927c69f-eastenders-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e0_QjMejtPBD data-wc=4><strong>Will Dot Cotton survive?</strong></p><p id=eALcBrXQPaK1 data-wc=38>Max Branning’s plans to get revenge on Albert Square also look to be in full swing, with scenes showing his brother Jack behind bars after attacking Charlie Cotton – will the doting dad lose custody of his children?</p><p id=eLx9pM-ajZlm data-wc=86>Meanwhile, there is set to be a new family arriving on the square. The Taylor clan look set to cause a stir when they hit Walford, with brash single mum Karen – played by Lorraine Stanley – turning up with children Keanu (played by Benidorm star Danny Walters), Bernadette (newcomer Clair Norris), and their younger brothers Riley and Chatham (real-life siblings Tom and Alfie Jacobs). And they are bringing along some family pets too: Bronson the dog and Rooney the bearded dragon Announcing the exciting news,</p><p id=er9Yoesqcpb8 data-wc=85>executive producer Sean O'Connor said: "I am hugely excited at the arrival of Karen and her family in Albert Square. They're noisy, brash and not to be messed with. Karen is a 20-a-day lioness, bringing up her kids with no support, no money and a very loud mouth. But though they may lack cash, the Taylors have love and warmth in spades. This summer is going to be explosive as the Taylors settle in Walford. The Square will never be quite the same again."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
