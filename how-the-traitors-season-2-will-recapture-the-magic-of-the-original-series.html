But, with the hype sky-high for the show, could it ever recapture the magic of season one?&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Wilf is revealed to be a traitor in The Traitors finale</figure><p id=eGrtGz7QmgB data-wc=89>No one quite knew what to expect when the show aired in 2022. With Claudia Winkleman giving some authority to the mystery new gameshow, I watched with curiosity only to be sucked into the show’s simple yet brilliant premise: three contestants are traitors, and the others are 'Faithful'. The viewer knows who is who, but the cast doesn’t. However, they have to vote for someone as a 'traitor' every night. If a traitor makes it to the end, they win. If the Faithfuls find them in time, they win.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5ac11006e177-traitors-table.jpg><p id=esNreqZ7jd4 data-wc=50>&nbsp;The delicious drama, paranoia and accusations sparked, as a result, led The Traitors to be the show that everyone was talking about - but with season two announced and all the secrets of the show already revealed by the first instalment, will season two measure up to viewers’ lofty expectations?&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="BBC reveals first look at The Traitors series 2 and reveals release date - and it's so close!" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/5e6197d92b90-claudia-winkleman-traitors.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="BBC reveals first look at The Traitors series 2 and reveals release date - and it's so close!" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>BBC reveals first look at The Traitors series 2 and reveals release date - and it's so close!</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="What our TV & Film experts have watched this week in December" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/013b03a950dd-thebuccaneersphoto010303.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="What our TV & Film experts have watched this week in December" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>What our TV & Film experts have watched this week in December</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eUGsDEi8fJj data-wc=106>After all, we know the premise very well now- so unless there are some surprises in store, there won’t be anything new. Among things that will have to change is the order in which the traitors are sent into the breakfast room in the morning, since any savvy player who watched season one will know that the final person to walk through will be a faithful, then there are the vaguely pointless games that the contestants play to earn their prize money that give us all time to catch up on Twitter - with a lukewarm reception, will they be bringing the prize raising games back?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a7d906d41e23-408122.jpg><p id=eNjQZHCI81W data-wc=28>It wouldn’t be the first time that shows that were once much-talked-about hits have since waned as viewer interests have changed, with Love Island being the perfect example.&nbsp;</p><p id=eIbLaJ1_lX1m data-wc=81>Whether it’s down to the ITV show's predilection to pick 'influencer' contestants, overflowing the market by introducing two seasons a year instead of one, or people just opting to watch a different romance show (both Married at First Sight and Netflix’s Love is Blind being hugely popular), Love Island was a show that was once considered to be peak reality TV, and has since lost much of its sparkle - so who’s to say the Traitors won’t have the same fate?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/96c9c6ee4672-traitors-cast-pic-t.jpg><p id=eNSrpkGUM5FQ data-wc=110>Personally, I don't think it will. Not yet, anyway. Firstly, one of the many reasons the show was a hit with viewers was the return of the average person to the reality show format. While Love Island went down the influencer rabbit hole and shows like I’m a Celebrity, Strictly Come Dancing and Dancing on Ice base have celebrity contestants, shows where the contestants could be your next-door neighbour are most definitely on the rise, with The Traitors, Jury Duty and Squid Game the Challenge being huge hits in over the last couple of years - and we have no reason to believe that season two won't do the same.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">HELLO!'s favourite Apple TV+ shows</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b1f08d6c76d7-brie-larson-as-elizabeth-zott.jpg><ul><li dir=ltr>Bad Sisters - A dark comedy that follows four sisters who set out to free a fifth from an abusive husband.&nbsp;</li><li dir=ltr>Hijack - Idris Elba leads the cast as Sam Nelson, a courageous hostage onboard a hijacked commercial plane on a seven-hour flight from Dubai to London.</li><li dir=ltr>Slow Horses - Star-studded spy thriller that follows a group of misfit intelligence agents who have been banished to the dumping ground department of MI5 after making career-ending mistakes.&nbsp;</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c2ed3abeae84-slowhorsesphoto030601.jpg><ul><li dir=ltr>Lessons in Chemistry - Brie Larson stars in this adaptation of Bonnie Garmus's bestselling novel.
