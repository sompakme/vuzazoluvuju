They have a bit more availability, but the company still has only less than 1,000 tickets remaining for their late-November show.</p><p><strong>WWE Friday Night SmackDown<br>Fri • Nov 24 • 6:45 PM<br>Allstate Arena, Rosemont, IL</strong></p><p>Available Tickets => 820<br>Current Setup => 12,943<br>Tickets Distributed => 12,085 (+88 since last week’s update)</p><p>Resale => 1,002</p><p>WWE is on a roll right now, as they bring one big event after another. Even a show like Payback, that some fans didn’t think would deliver much, was able to really pack a punch. If anything, the company has a ton of interest, and it is showing in their ticket sales.</p><p>It’s<a href=#> also nothing new for WWE to break records</a> around every corner. There are lot of things that they can thank for that. In the meantime, please keep it tuned with us here at<a href=#> Ringside News</a> for more on this situation and so much more.</p><p>What’s your take on WWE selling out Survivor Series already?
