After gaining a strong regional following in Los Angeles, he became an internet phenomenon before the release of his hit single, "Thotiana." The song was hot but became a hit record after <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Cardi B</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>YG</a> hopped on the remix. Yesterday, the rapper released his new project, the aptly titled, Dirt Bag which includes the highly anticipated banger, "Disrespectful." He previewed the song following an altercation with his sister and mother that went viral as well as after his two ex-girlfriends got the same Ben Franklin tattoo as him.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Blueface's bars live up to the song's title. He references B2K and reminds everyone how much of a savage he really is. "I'm at the Ritz blowin' zips (Ritz Carlton)/ This a non-smoking room but ain't no hoe tell me shit," he raps. "'Cause bitch I'm the shit/ Had to kick my own blood out/ They must've forgot I was a crip," he continues in reference to his little feud with his sister and mom.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Peep the full record below.
