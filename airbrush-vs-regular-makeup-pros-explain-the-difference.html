Although it seems like a process reserved for professionals, you can uses airbrush makeup at home. Aside from the application method, how does airbrush makeup differ from regular makeup?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Neil Scibelli</a>, it comes down to texture and finish. He says that airbrush makeup is usually in a semi-matte finish while regular makeup is available in a range of options. And because airbrush makeup relies on air, you get a much more even distribution of product resulting in more even coverage.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, regular makeup is more customizable and user-friendly. “It’s easier to blend makeup by hand to the desired coverage you’re looking for, as well as blend multiple shades together,” he says. “It’s also a bit easier to remove, add, and blend makeup by hand versus an airbrush finish that dries quickly." If you're considering giving airbrush makeup a try, find an expert break down the mode of application below.<br></p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Neil Scibelli</a> is a celebrity makeup artist whose clients include Elle Macpherson and Melissa Etheridge.</li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Lex Smith</a> is a makeup artist and global artist for Tarte Cosmetics.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-airbrush-makeup-works></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Airbrush Makeup Works</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Airbrush makeup is applied with an air-power tool that dispenses product in spray-like form. “A foundation shade cartridge is placed in the machine and the foundation is then dispensed into the applicator and air sprayed onto the skin,”&nbsp;Scibelli says. “Through the years, the machines and cartridges of foundations have become smaller and more portable for at-home use.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But these days, airbrush makeup doesn’t only apply to face coverage. According to Tarte global artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Lex Smith</a>, you can also airbrush other makeup such as eyeshadow, blush, and lipstick. “You just need to make sure any other products you are using are specifically formulated for airbrush application,” Smith says.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-types-of-airbrush-coverage></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Types of Airbrush Coverage</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As mentioned above, Scibelli says that airbrush makeup tends to give more of a semi-matte finish. But he emphasizes that it's buildable, too. “Airbrush makeup can be layered, so it's up to the person on how sheer or full coverage they're looking to go,” he says. “You can start sheer and build up to a medium to full coverage with layers.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Airbrush makeup also gives off the “perfect” look by providing skin even application. “Airbrush makeup typically provides a smooth, flawless, and high-definition finish if applied correctly,” says Smith. “It also offers a buildable coverage ranging from sheer to full while creating a lightweight, natural-looking, and skin-like finish.”&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-benefits-of-airbrush-makeup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Benefits of Airbrush Makeup</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both Scibelli and Khudabakhshyan say that the biggest benefit to airbrush makeup is the flawless even application. “You can end up with a beautiful, even flawless finish,” says Scibelli. “It’s a lot like spray painting, so there aren’t many tools involved. Airbrushing can also be a great option for someone who has found their perfect match and is looking for a one-stop shop for their complexion.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The main reason people opt for airbrush makeup is the ability to provide a flawless, long-lasting finish, adjustable coverage, and a lightweight feel on the skin,” adds Smith. “I personally have tried it, and it feels super lightweight but is still similar to many other traditional products that aren’t airbrush.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Other benefits include not needing as many touchups as regular makeup application. Scibelli says that regular makeup can build shine throughout the day and cause a bit of creasing that you’ll need to tend to.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-downsides-of-airbrush-makeup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Downsides of Airbrush Makeup</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the biggest cons to airbrush makeup is not being able to blend or customize your finish once it’s sprayed on. Scibelli explains that it is harder to do anything once makeup has dried, so you’re basically committed to wearing the final product.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regular makeup is also easier to use for your everyday routine. “Traditional makeup is very accessible, easier to apply, and has so much versatility as far as the product choices and variety of looks you can create,” says Smith. “ Most importantly, so many brands have a wide range of shade options.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-get-the-look></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Get the Look</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Luminess</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are great airbrush makeup tools on the market if you want to try them out yourself. Brands like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Temptu</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Luminess</a> make user-friendly airbrush machines to give you that flawless feel.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But if you want to get that “airbrush” look sans the tool, you can turn to regular makeup to get the same effect. Scibelli recommends Beauty Pie’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Traceless SPF30 Mineral sunscreen + Primer</a> to lock in makeup and control oil production on the skin so you get that velvety airbrush feel to the skin. He also loves <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Pat McGrath Labs Sublime Perfection Blurring Under-Eye Setting Powder</a>, which he says is perfect for blurring fine lines, dark circles, and undereye bags.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Smith says that it’s important to look for a lightweight foundation like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Tarte Face Tape</a>, so that you get that long-lasting, buildable coverage that won’t look too cakey or crease throughout the day. Then, you’ll want to make sure to set everything with a setting spray.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All in all, when deciding which method of makeup application you should opt for, it’s all about personal preference. “I wouldn’t say one is better than the other; it is more dependent on what you are looking to achieve and comfort level with application,” says Smith. “I would say at the end of the day, it all depends on the occasion and the desired makeup look.”&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-frequently-asked-questions-b634adc3-a3ce-4711-8603-b49091652958></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=51><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Is airbrush makeup better for weddings?</span></p><p>While it’s still up to personal preference, Scibelli says he thinks airbrush makeup can be a great fit for a special occasion like a wedding day. “It’s long-lasting and traditionally a drier formula, so it requires less touch-ups,”&nbsp;he says.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How long does airbrush makeup last?</span></p><p>“Airbrush makeup is known for its longevity and can typically last for up to 18 hours depending on the application technique, skin type, and specific product used,” says Smith.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=3 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can I apply airbrush makeup myself or do I need help from a professional?</span></p><p><br>“You can apply airbrush makeup yourself if you have the necessary equipment and skills,” says&nbsp;Smith. “I have found it does require a lot of practice and precision.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=4 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Is airbrush makeup waterproof or sweat-resistant?</span></p><p><strong><br></strong><br>“Many airbrush products are water-resistant or sweatproof to some extent; the level of water and sweat resistance can vary depending on the formulation, but they will require touching up after prolonged exposure to water or excessive sweating,” says Smith<strong>.</strong></p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wKKpm6qlqLVuwtJmqZ6fpaGus3nMmqKeraBihHqDkmxvcQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
