Things are different now as he no longer has as much power now. That said, McMahon made a rare appearance at the WWE Headquarters recently.</p><p>Ever since Nick Khan took over as the President and Triple H took over as the COO of WWE, the company has been veering away from the usual Vince McMahon regime. Ari Emanuel, the CEO of Endeavor is largely responsible for all these changes as well.</p><p>Vince McMahon hasn’t done much in WWE for a while now after Emanuel made Triple H the head of Creative without McMahon having any capacity. According to <a href=#>PWInsider</a>, Vince McMahon was at the company’s annual holiday party, which took place at the new HQ for the first time this past Wednesday evening. This was a rare appearance for McMahon, who hasn’t been around there much.</p><p>”Vince McMahon, who has not been seen much at WWE Headquarters of late, was at the company’s annual holiday party, which was held at the new HQ for the first time this past Wednesday evening.</p><p>McMahon, who&nbsp;we are told would not regularly attend the holiday party in the past, was not only in attendance but making the rounds talking with lots of company employees.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>In speaking to several who were in attendance at the party, which was exclusively for employees, he was described as “approachable” and “friendly.””</p><p>WWE is also disregarding a <a href=#>religious rule from Vince McMahon</a>. That said, Vince McMahon also has no&nbsp;<a href=#>intention of parting ways with WWE anytime soon</a>. We’ll have to see how WWE will continue to grow without his influence.</p><p>What’s your opinion on this Vince McMahon story? Are you shocked by it?
