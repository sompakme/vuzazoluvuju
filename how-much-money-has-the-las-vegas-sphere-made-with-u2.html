Aronofsky’s Postcards From Earth has had 111 screenings through Nov. 30, and has brought in $44.5 million in revenue, averaging $400,000 per showing.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The company adds that Formula 1 took over the Sphere for the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix last month, and that it also has a robust advertising business through its brand campaigns on the “exosphere,” or the globe that visitors to Las Vegas see just off the strip. The company says that NFL Sunday Ticket, PlayStation, Meta, Xbox and Coca-Cola have also signed on for campaigns.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">U2 opened the $2.3 billion Sphere on Sep. 29 <a href=#>with their first performance</a>, igniting social media as images from the venue spread across TikTok, Instagram, X and YouTube.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The building contains the world’s largest interior and exterior wraparound LED displays, and features 160,000 speakers and other tech to change the senses of attendees, as The Hollywood Reporter <a href=#>explained in a story</a> teeing up the opening.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">But while live events and concerts like U2 are at the core of the Sphere strategy, the company also wants to have original programming to run on days when there are no concerts. Hence Aronofsky’s Postcards, an immersive, narrative documentary.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It really is a different medium because of the immersive nature of all the images that you create and how it translates to the viewer,” the director <a href=#>told THR</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Sphere disclosed the numbers as it announced that it would be selling $225 million in private debt to an institutional buyer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmpqeemsZuv8%2BhnKudXaGutHnVnp6aq12qf26wwKupnqZdlr%2Bwus6fqqSxXaeyt7HNrpxmaWJognh9kWtwbWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
