Famously, the multiple Grammy Award-winning singer dated rapper Chris Brown. After first meeting as teens in 2004, the pair had a tumultuous relationship, as per <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>In 2009, Brown subjected Rihanna to a brutal attack. <a href=#>TMZ</a> obtained the official police report, which details the "horrific" injuries he inflicted upon Rihanna, including bleeding, swelling, and bruising. Speaking with <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>, she opened up about the abuse. "A lot of women, a lot of young girls, are still going through it," she reflected. "A lot of young boys too. It's not a subject to sweep under the rug, so I can't just dismiss it like it wasn't anything, or I don't take it seriously." The "Umbrella" singer added that she did not want to be defined by the abuse or perceived as a victim.</p><p dir=ltr>Since then, Brown has been accused of abusing other women. In 2019, he was arrested in France on suspicion of rape, though he wasn't charged and argued that the accusation was false, as per <a href=#>CNN</a>. Then, in 2021, <a href=#>TMZ</a> reported that Brown had been accused of battery against a woman, yet another allegation in his long history of domestic violence claims.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233.
