What breaks my heart is that people talk about it … but are not about it,” Wonder said at the gala that ended early Sunday morning. “We write about it, we sing about it, the musicians play about it, we pray about it, but what we need to do is do about it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“So I beg of you, those of you who can see what we’re doing to this planet, those of you that can see the anger in people’s faces, those of you that can hear the anger and the confusion that is on social media, those of you that feel that you have to follow those broken hearts, we as artists have to mend those hearts with love,” he continued. “We can stop and put an end and ask for all of the 32 nations of the world to have a truce and stop the fighting and begin to love. It’s not impossible.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">While he spoke, Knight sang softly and nodded her head in agreement. Warwick chimed in with closing words: “What Stevie has just given to you, please take that to heart. Take it home and share it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Davis’ white-hot event at The Beverly Hilton, held a day before the <a href=# id=auto-tag_grammy-awards_1 data-tag=grammy-awards>Grammy Awards</a>, began on Saturday night with a rocking performance by Green Day, who are celebrating the 30th anniversary of their breakthrough album Dookie and the 20th anniversary of the multi-hit affair American Idiot. Serena Williams introduced the group, calling them “my favorite band of literally all time.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Don’t cheer, vote!,” Billie Joe Armstrong said after his performance.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Other performers included multiple acts nominated for best new artist on Sunday. Victoria Monet danced with skill and precision; <a href=# id=auto-tag_ice-spice_1 data-tag=ice-spice>Ice Spice</a> twerked and asked “where’s the baddies?”; Noah Kahan strummed his guitar and sang with strength; and an excited <a href=# id=auto-tag_jelly-roll_1 data-tag=jelly-roll>Jelly Roll</a> won over the audience, exclaiming: “I’m nominated for two [<a href=# id=auto-tag_grammys_1 data-tag=grammys>Grammys</a>] and I’m loving every fucking part of it!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Breakthrough country singer Lainey Wilson joined Jelly Roll for their hit “Save Me” and also sang “I’m Just Ken” from Barbie — filling in for Ryan Gosling — alongside the song’s writers Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Josh Groban and Michael Trotter Jr. of the duo The War and Treaty, also nominated for best new artist, joined forces for a memorable performance of “Bridge Over Troubled Water”; Colombian singer Maluma said he was proud to represent Latinos with his performance; while Public Enemy and the Isley Brothers hit the stage in honor of Sony music publishing chairman and CEO Jon Platt, who received the Recording Academy’s Grammy Salute to Industry Icons award.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The event was packed with famous faces — who Davis introduced by reading off their stats and achievements — including Adrien Brody, Smokey Robinson, Mariah Carey, Jon Bon Jovi, Martina Navratilova, Berry Gordy, Frankie Valli, Earth, Wind & Fire, Julia Garner, Emilio and Gloria Estefan, Lenny Kravitz and Luke Combs.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Davis also took a moment to honor returning guest Nancy Pelosi. “Lately I’ve always introduced this person first, because she deserves it. This is the 24th consecutive year of her attendance, of her participating, of her being among you to celebrate music. She’s the United States’ 52nd speaker of the House of Representatives,” he said of Pelosi, who earned a standing ovation and typically receives rock star treatment from the audience at the gala. “She served the country in this position for eight years and supported millions of people with her life-saving values and principles. She’s a true hero.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq1%2BowabCyJ5ksKeembKzecalmJ2xo2K4r7XGoatmn6Kasq95w5qwZqGTmnq0vMicnGaolaezsL7MZpqloaaaeqWt1aKqZp%2BRoa5ufZFsbHFpZGl%2BeXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
