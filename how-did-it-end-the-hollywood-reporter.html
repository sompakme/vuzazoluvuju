As expected, the finale featured a couple of familiar faces, resolved the&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=B613 data-scaytid=8>B613</span>&nbsp;case and left some things open for interpretation.</p><p>Ultimately, Attorney General David Rosen (Josh <span data-scayt_word=Malina data-scaytid=14>Malina</span>) — aka the most innocent person in D.C. whose hat was the whitest among everyone on the show — would pay the price for everything and was killed off. In the end, it was Cyrus (Jeff Perry) — the vice president of the United States — who killed David as he proved yet again that he would do anything to make the Oval Office his own in a storyline that Scandal has followed since its start. The series has always explored how the Oval Office and lust for power corrupts those who come near it, and Cyrus killing David illustrated how far he would go to get the highest office in the country. As for Cyrus, Olivia demands his resignation and he willingly agrees as he acknowledges that the things that he has done in his lust for power are demons from which he can never escape.</p><p>“It’s always been my contention that the Oval Office, in our show, was a place that corrupted anybody who came near it and the closer you came, the more corrupt it made you and the more damaged it made you,” <span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=23>Rhimes</span> told reporters, including <span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=24>THR</span>, ahead of the finale. “Olivia started out as the character that we knew who has very much believed in how important this particular kind of power was and how molding it and being a part of it was — and we watched her, like everybody else, become absolutely corrupted by it, and make all the same mistakes that everybody else makes to get what she wants from it.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>That reveal capped a final season that focused largely on how Olivia (Kerry Washington), who assumed control of&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=B613 data-scaytid=27>B613</span>&nbsp;in the season six finale, had to fight her way back into the light and stand in the sun of what’s right and, most importantly, who she really is at her core. Given the chance to flee by her father Rowan (Joe Morton), the one-time head of <span data-scayt_word=B613 data-scaytid=28>B613</span>, Olivia opted instead to tell the truth and find her moral center again. Rowan, as it turns out, shockingly opted to do the same and testified that he created <span data-scayt_word=B613 data-scaytid=29>B613</span> and did so in a response to a need: because of white men whose privilege left the Republic in a state of neglect. Rowan confesses to his work fixing elections, acts of terrorism and more — but he did so for a reason. “I am responsible for the fact that this nation still stands,” he testifies. “I wake up every morning and I make America great.” Rowan’s final monologue is a larger statement about race in America and that the white men who run the country were ultimately controlled by a black man. Rowan’s testimony brings Jake (Scott Foley) down as he takes the fall for <span data-scayt_word=B613 data-scaytid=30>B613</span>.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>“One of the things that Olivia says in the penultimate episode is this idea of standing up and being somebody who puts everything out in the open is important,”&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=15>Rhimes</span>&nbsp;told reporters, including&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=21>THR</span>,&nbsp;ahead of the series ender. “Whether or not everybody pays for what they’ve done, I don’t know that that’s what the finale is about as much as it’s about seeing what happens once that choice has been made.”</p><p><span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=16>Rhimes</span> reiterated that she has always been more “Team Olivia” than any other romantic pairing for her D.C. fixer and the finale would serve to complete Olivia’s “evolution” from the time viewers met her — when she’d already rigged a presidential election — to what happens after she finds her moral center again this season.” So&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=post-B613 data-scaytid=22>post-B613</span>, did Olivia wind up with her fairy tale ending with Fitz and a lifetime of making jam in Vermont? The end of the series featured Olivia’s portrait in the National Portrait Gallery — leaving viewers to decide for themselves if Olivia would wind up becoming president or was rewarded for her role in cleaning up D.C.’s corruption and becoming the ultimate fixer. (A nice touch: <span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=17>Rhimes</span>‘ daughter, Harper, was the young girl left looking up at the portrait, which said “We the People” along its side.)</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>As&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=45>Rhimes</span>&nbsp;warned, the finale also left&nbsp;<strong>that</strong>&nbsp;and a few other storylines open for viewers to interpret on their own as&nbsp;Scandal&nbsp;jumped forward following the conclusion of the&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=B613 data-scaytid=48>B613</span>&nbsp;trial.&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=49>Rhimes</span>&nbsp;and producers have no immediate plans of discussing how the series ultimately ended and intentionally wanted to leave the audience to determine the show’s ultimate takeaway about politics in D.C. (<span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=50>Rhimes</span>&nbsp;noted that the finale was more about completing Olivia’s journey than making a statement about backroom dealings in D.C.)</p><p>The finale also left viewers to decide if Olivia and Fitz (Tony Goldwyn) got their happy ending and life of jam-making in Vermont.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>That said, here’s a look at where everyone wound up.</p><p>•&nbsp;<strong>Olivia (Washington)</strong>: Cleaned up D.C., stood in the sun and was happily her own person. The ending also implied that the path was clear for a romantic relationship with Fitz, free of <span data-scayt_word=B613 data-scaytid=57>B613</span> and secrets. <span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=58>Rhimes</span>‘ ending also reiterated a theme that she has explored in the past: that women do not need a man to be happy, though her romantic path to Fitz remained open. Free from working in Washington, Olivia is left to do whatever she wants as she turns her back on D.C.</p><p>•&nbsp;<strong>Fitz (Goldwyn)</strong>: The former president still has his foundation and likely now has an open path to a romantic future with the love of his life: Olivia. What’s more: his legacy is left untarnished. He becomes Marcus’ first backer in what could be his eventual run for office.</p><p>•&nbsp;<strong><span data-scayt_word=Mellie data-scaytid=62>Mellie</span>&nbsp;(Young)</strong>: Cleared from all wrong-doing, <span data-scayt_word=Mellie data-scaytid=63>Mellie</span> remained president — with a romantic relationship with Marcus. What’s more, she made gun control central to her platform. Olivia winds up telling <span data-scayt_word=Mellie data-scaytid=64>Mellie</span> that she has always been able to stand on her own two feet and leaves her to run the country — without her.</p><p><strong>• Cyrus (Jeff Perry): </strong>Resigns as vice president of the United States and confesses that he can’t ever escape from the sins he has committed in his thirst for power.</p><p><strong>• Abby (Darby&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Stanchfield data-scaytid=54>Stanchfield</span>): </strong>Lost the love of her life in David Rosen. Abby’s ending was the most open-ended, though it’s likely she wound up remaining at work for Quinn Perkins and Associates.</p><p><strong>• Quinn (Katie Lowes): </strong>Got her happy ending: Married Charlie and is happy with their child —&nbsp;and running Quinn Perkins and Associates.</p><p><strong>• Huck (Guillermo Diaz): </strong>Remains by Abby’s side as she grieves for David.</p><p><strong>• Jake (Scott Foley): </strong>Takes the fall for <span data-scayt_word=B613 data-scaytid=69>B613</span> and spends the rest of his life in jail. Olivia apologizes to him for making him step out of the sun. Jake admits that he got something out of the whole thing — he loved Olivia. Jake becomes the only person who pays for everyone’s sins,&nbsp;letting all the Gladiators off the hook for everything that they’ve done.</p><p><strong>• Rowan (Joe Morton): </strong>His testimony helps set all the Gladiators free — and bring down Jake and all of <span data-scayt_word=B613 data-scaytid=74>B613</span>. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>• David (Josh&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Malina data-scaytid=67>Malina</span>): </strong>Pays the price for Cyrus’ lust for power and is killed by the vice president.</p><p><strong>• Charlie (George&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Newbern data-scaytid=71>Newbern</span>):</strong> Is released from jail and works for his wife at Quinn Perkins and Associates.&nbsp;</p><p>•&nbsp;<strong>Marcus (Cornelius Smith Jr.): </strong>The latest Gladiator likely winds up in the White House — as the first husband to president <span data-scayt_word=Mellie data-scaytid=68>Mellie</span> Grant. What’s more, he’s going to explore his own political future, with Fitz backing him.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Scandal, which helped cement&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=83>Rhimes</span>&nbsp;as a mega-producer and brand of her own, marked the close of prolific&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word="showrunner's" data-scaytid=88>showrunner’s</span>&nbsp;chapter on broadcast as every series she creates going forward will be for Netflix, where she signed a nine-figure overall deal.</p><p>In terms of&nbsp;Scandal‘s future,&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=89>Rhimes</span>&nbsp;— who once seriously considered doing a&nbsp;<a href=#><span data-scayt_word=B613 data-scaytid=90>B613</span>&nbsp;spinoff</a>&nbsp;— confirmed that the end of the series is indeed the end of the franchise and there are no offshoots planned: “Scandal&nbsp;is done.” While it would be easy to revisit the world of corruption and Gladiators on ABC’s&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Rhimes-produced data-scaytid=93>Rhimes-produced</span>&nbsp;drama&nbsp;How to Get Away With Murder&nbsp;after both series&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>crossed over</a>&nbsp;earlier this season, there are no current plans for that, either, though she stressed that the decision ultimately lies with&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=showrunner data-scaytid=94>showrunner</span>&nbsp;Pete&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Nowalk data-scaytid=95>Nowalk</span>.&nbsp;</p><p>What did you think of the&nbsp;Scandal&nbsp;series finale?
