(Lady Anson died in 2020.) “The Queen’s entrance into the gardens is right next to their cottage. It is essentially her backyard, her solitude, and her privacy. She was giving that up in gifting Harry and Meghan Frogmore Cottage. We all thought it was very big of her. She said, ‘I hope they’ll respect it.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k9BE3yM3fNHBTyNhRBobHf-1920-80.jpg><p>The Prince and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/diana/>Princess of Wales</a> now live on the Windsor estate themselves, relocating from Kensington Palace in London to Adelaide Cottage in early September 2022, shortly before the late Queen died on September 8. <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-andrew/>Prince Andrew</a> and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/sarah-ferguson/>Sarah Ferguson</a>, though divorced for 27 years, both live together in Royal Lodge, which is also on the Windsor estate.</p><p>Princess Diana also lived at Kensington Palace (often called “KP” for short) for most of her life post-marriage to the then Prince Charles, and Harry and Meghan lived in Nottingham Cottage on KP’s grounds before moving to Frogmore. “Kensington Palace sounds very regal, of course it does,” Meghan said in the couple’s six-part Netflix docuseries, Harry & Meghan. “It says ‘palace’ in the name. But Nottingham Cottage was so small.” Harry agreed: “The whole thing is on a slight lean, [with] really low ceilings,” he said. “So, I don’t know who was there before, but they must have been very short.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H3LUCwmoFSnhk2T8dwdCHG-1920-80.jpg><p>Harry and Meghan moved into their current home, a $14.65 million estate in Montecito, in July 2020.

The home is about 100 miles away from Los Angeles, and, while the Sussexes could have asked Charles for financial help, Harry and Meghan were intent on purchasing their new home independently. “Harry could’ve asked Charles to contribute toward the cost of the house, but he chose not to,”<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/why-prince-harry-didnt-ask-royals-to-pay-for-montecito-house/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none> <u>Us Weekly</u></a> reports. “Getting his dad financially involved would result in the royals having control over him.
