Yes You, the Mysterious "iPad user 12345" on Zoom!</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:224>Ever joined a Zoom meeting only to see yourself labelled with the thrilling moniker of "iPad user 12345"? Let's face it, that doesn't exactly inspire confidence during your presentation on the revolutionary uses of sporks.</p><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:182>Fear not, fellow Zoomer! Shedding your numerical anonymity is a breeze. In fact, it's easier than explaining to your grandma why you keep asking her to download that "TikTok" app.</p><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:116>Here's how to pimp your Zoom profile on your iPad and trade in "iPad user 12345" for something a little more...you.</p><h2 data-sourcepos=9:1-9:48>The Great Name Change: A (Painless) Odyssey</h2><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:54><strong>Step 1: Initiate Operation "Goodbye, Bland Name!"</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:177>Open the Zoom app on your iPad. Just tap that familiar blue icon – you know the one, it looks suspiciously like a certain social media platform after a questionable paint job.</p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:52><strong>Step 2: Dive Deep (But Not Really) into Settings</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:182>Look at the bottom right corner of your screen. See that little tab with your initials or profile picture? Give it a friendly tap. This is your gateway to Zoomian personalization.</p><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:42><strong>Step 3: Behold! The Name Throne Awaits</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:313>You'll be greeted by a screen with your current profile info. Don't be intimidated by all the buttons and options – we just need one shiny knight in this armor-clad interface. Look for something that says "Display Name" or "Profile Name" (they're basically the same thing). <strong>This is where the magic happens!</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=23:1-23:36><strong>Step 4: Unleash Your Inner Bard!</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=25:1-25:351>Here comes the fun part! This is your chance to craft the name that will strike fear (or amusement) into the hearts of your fellow Zoommates. Will you go with your trusty nickname, unleash your alter ego, or perhaps channel your favorite historical figure (because who wouldn't want to attend a meeting led by Genghis Khan... virtually, of course)?</p><p data-sourcepos=27:1-27:25><strong>Step 5: Seal the Deal</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=29:1-29:135>Once you've chosen your masterpiece, tap that glorious "Save" button. And just like that, you've transformed from a number to a name!</p><p data-sourcepos=31:1-31:194><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You've successfully broken free from the shackles of generic Zoom names. Now go forth and conquer your next meeting, armed with the power of a truly distinguished profile.</p><p data-sourcepos=33:1-33:307><strong>P.S.</strong> While you're in the settings, why not explore some of the other fun features? You can change your profile picture (maybe to that embarrassing cat filter photo – we all have one), or play around with your video background (who wouldn't want to virtually attend a meeting from the surface of Mars?).</p><p data-sourcepos=35:1-35:142>So go forth, personalize your Zoom experience, and remember – with a great name comes great responsibility. So use it wisely (or hilariously)!</p>7913003049042949089<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWxfnby4edOoZJygkaO0pnnYqKyrZZSewLG4wLJkp5mdmnqwuoyzpqilXp3Brrg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
