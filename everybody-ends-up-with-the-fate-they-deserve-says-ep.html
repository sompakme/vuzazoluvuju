And the show lived up to its title, as there were indeed two major character deaths that transpired.</p><p>But first, several revelations were made during the episode. First off, Mary Gaines, the woman whose body was discovered after the fire in Emily’s home, was actually Victoria’s mother. She had summoned Victoria (<strong>Madeleine</strong> <strong>Stowe</strong>) to her death bed, and that’s when Victoria decided to use her corpse and pass it off as her own. [Update: Read Stowe’s interview with <span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=8>THR</span> <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.]</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Before her mother died, she confessed to Victoria who the latter’s father was. Turns out it was … the man who raped her?!</p><p>Meanwhile, Emily (<strong>Emily <span data-scayt_word=VanCamp data-scaytid=7>VanCamp</span></strong>) confesses in court to Victoria’s murder so that she can get transferred to a maximum security prison, from where, naturally, Nolan (<strong>Gabriel Mann</strong>) can help her escape after putting his hacking skills to work.</p><p>After doing some investigative work, Jack (<strong>Nick <span data-scayt_word=Wechsler data-scaytid=9>Wechsler</span></strong>) and Emily discover the truth about the corpse, and that Ben (<strong>Brian</strong> <strong><span data-scayt_word=Hallisay data-scaytid=11>Hallisay</span></strong>) actually died in Mary’s house —&nbsp;and finally they get to make out (and then some) after four seasons of buildup. But, alas, their happiness is short-lived: White Gold (<strong>Courtney Love</strong>) shows up at the house to kill Emily and instead finds Jack, whom she stabs. Working off a tip from David Clarke (<strong>James</strong> <strong><span data-scayt_word=Tupper data-scaytid=14>Tupper</span></strong>), the police show up just in time and Jack is admitted to the hospital, injured but alive. Subsequently, Emily vows to kill Victoria. Later ? in the hospital ? Jack asks David for Emily’s hand in marriage, and he approves.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a move that would prove ill-conceived, Victoria reveals the truth to Louise (<strong>Elena</strong> <strong><span data-scayt_word=Satine data-scaytid=16>Satine</span></strong>) after the latter gives an emotional eulogy at Victoria’s funeral — which was attended by neither of her two living children, Charlotte (<strong>Christa B. Allen</strong>) nor Patrick (<strong>Justin Hartley</strong>). So what does Louise do? Find Emily and Nolan and tell them exactly where to find Victoria. And she even leads Emily directly to her nemesis.</p><p>Cue the moment from the promo where Emily is pointing a gun at Victoria. After noting that she’d never killed anyone, preferring her enemies to “live in agony,” a gunshot is fired at Victoria — but not by Emily. Unbeknownst to his daughter, David followed her and ends up pulling the trigger of his own gun.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>However, Emily and David forget the rule of TV/movie kills: Never turn your back on a dead body unless you’re sure that person is dead. Victoria picks up Emily’s gun and fires, shooting Emily. Emily is fine, and her dad ends up getting a “compassionate release” from prison. David later dies on their porch swing after telling Emily he will love her to “infinity.”</p><p>The last several minutes tied everything up (nearly): We learn that the “two graves” were for Victoria and David. Jack and Emily get married —&nbsp;and she gives him a very Sammy-like Labrador retriever puppy as a wedding present. Charlotte and Emily have apparently made up, and Charlotte serves as a bridesmaid.</p><p>Cut to a flashback in which it’s revealed that Emily was saved by a heart transplant — a heart donated by Victoria via Charlotte. Then Emily awakens and it’s all a dream … or is it?</p><p>Elsewhere, having a crisis of conscience, <span data-scayt_word=Margaux data-scaytid=22>Margaux</span> (<strong><span data-scayt_word=Karine data-scaytid=23>Karine</span> <span data-scayt_word=Vanasse data-scaytid=24>Vanasse</span></strong>) decides to confess to all the wrong-doings she’s committed — but we never learn her ultimate fate.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Meanwhile, with Nolan questioning his purpose post-Amanda’s plan for revenge, she gives him a gift too, setting him up to help people on their own quests for revenge and justice. Had the show been picked up for a fifth season, <span data-scayt_word=Nayar data-scaytid=25>Nayar</span> tells <span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=26>THR</span>, that cliffhanger “could have spurred the show into a season five. … If there had been a fifth season, it would have set up a new Revenge.”</p><p>As for the finale, he believes that fans will be satisfied.<strong>“</strong>I think they will be thrilled and surprised and, more than anything, moved,” he says. “There are so many moving performances and scenes.”</p><p>While <span data-scayt_word=Nayar data-scaytid=29>Nayar</span> didn’t know that “Two Graves” was ultimately going to be a series finale —&nbsp;news of the <span data-scayt_word=cancellation data-scaytid=31>cancellation</span> came after production wrapped —&nbsp;he says he wouldn’t have done anything differently if he had known.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p><strong>“</strong>Honestly, that’s the thing: We were still finishing the season, and the first four seasons, in an epic and definitive way,” he says. “I can’t think of a single thing I would have done differently if I had been told ages ago. I’m super thrilled with it. I think that everybody ends up with the fate they deserve and that every dream comes true in a way, and so does every nightmare.”</p><p>What did you think about the Revenge series finale?
