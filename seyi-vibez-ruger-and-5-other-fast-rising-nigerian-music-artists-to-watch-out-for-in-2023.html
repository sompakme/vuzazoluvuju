Seyi Vibez</h2><p class=align-left>The Nigerian street-pop act has been underground for a while before breaking into the mainstream with his hit track Chance, which appeared on his debut album Billion Dollar Baby.</p><p class=align-left>Seyi Vibez has amassed a following since his major breakthrough in late 2022.

His deliveries are channelled through indigenous Yoruba sounds for more authenticity.</p><p class=align-left>Seyi Vibez started this year with the release of a 5-track extended play, Memory Card that recently ranks as the No. 1 album on the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nigeria Apple Music Top Albums Chart</a>. It is only exciting to fold our arms and watch how the uprising intends to hold down his growing fandom this year.</p><h2>4. Oxlade</h2><p class=align-left>Oxlade has been active on the Nigerian music scene for a while, with two extended plays to boast of.</p><p class=align-left>The pop artist was able to stay atop the highly competitive 2022 airwaves that witnessed Burna Boy’s Last Last, Asake’s range of hits, Kizz Daniel’s Buga, alongside his Colours-show hit single Ku Lo Sa.</p><p class=align-left>His love-infected 2022 hit track demonstrates that Oxlade has more tricks up his sleeve, and we can only hope he proves it this year.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/344eb431f80c6dc3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“Where is the apology?” Burna Boy finally breaks silence after flopped Lagos concert, Nigerians react</span></p></a><h2>5.

Fave</h2><p class=align-left>The uprising act under Mr Eazi’s EmPawa imprint has gained fans with her delectable sonic deliveries. Her lyrics are emotional and slide their way into hearts at first hearing.</p><p class=align-left>Fave has proven to be another growing diva in the Nigerian music industry, with the potential to walk into the crown of global fame like Tems.</p><h2>7. Ruger</h2><p class=align-left>Ruger is a fast-rising artist signed to the Nigerian record label Jonzing World. He broke into the scene with his sensational track, ‘One Shirt’.</p><p class=align-left>One shirt was an impressive track that did not fully establish Ruger's sonic and lyrical prowess.
