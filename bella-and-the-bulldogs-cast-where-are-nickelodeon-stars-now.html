But honestly, I don’t know much, nor would you catch me just randomly watching a game if it’s on.”</p><p>Besides Lilimar, the show starred <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Brec Bassinger</strong></a> as cheerleader Bella Dawson who showed off her epic talents and quickly became the new quarterback for her middle school’s football team. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Coy Stewart</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jackie Radinsky</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Buddy Handleson</strong></a>,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Froy Gutierrez</a></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Haley Tju</strong></a> also starred alongside the actresses throughout show’s two seasons.</p><p>“There is not a day that goes where I don’t miss my Bella and the Bulldogs family and being on set,” Brec said in <a href=#>a YouTube video</a> from August 2017. “It was literally two of the best years of my life and I’m still in the stage where when I’m watching reruns of the show, I miss it so much that I can’t help but cry. I know I’ll get to the point of my life when I watch it, I’m just so happy and grateful for those experiences which I am, but as of right now, I still just miss it so much that I can’t help but cry. I love them, I miss them so much. I miss the cast, everyone.”</p><p>During the same video, she also revealed some behind-the-scenes secrets from the show’s set. “We had so many bloopers on that show,” Brec revealed, noting that one of her “proudest moments” was being able to throw a football correctly!</p><p>Since the show ended, the cast went on to accomplished a bunch in Hollywood.
