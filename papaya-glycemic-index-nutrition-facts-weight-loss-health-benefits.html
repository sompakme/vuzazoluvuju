This rating means that eating papayas will not immediately raise blood sugar levels, but other fruits (such as&nbsp;<a href=#>peaches</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>oranges</a>) may be a better fit depending on your own goals and medical conditions.¹ ²</p><p><h3>Glycemic Index</h3></p><p><h3>Serving Size</h3></p><p><h3>Carbohydrate* per Serving (g)</h3></p><p><h3>GL per Serving</h3></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-global.website-files.com/63ed08484c069d0492f5b0bc/6541520228094dba602b24b5_pexels-alleksana-4113868-p-500.webp alt sizes="(max-width: 991px) 90vw, 47vw" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=food-h2>Nutritional Facts</h2><p>Papayas are an excellent source of vitamin C, with one medium fruit providing 224% of the recommended daily intake. Papayas are also a good source of folate, vitamin A, magnesium, copper, pantothenic acid, and fiber. This nutrition profile is packed with antioxidants that help safeguard the human body against free radicals and provide various other health benefits.</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>The nutritional information below is for 100 g of raw papaya.²</p><p><h3>Calories</h3></p><p><h3>Carbs</h3></p><p><h3>Protein</h3></p><p><h3>Fiber</h3></p><p><h3>Cholesterol</h3></p><p><h3>Vitamins</h3></p><p>A (47 µg), B6 (0.04 mg), C (60.9 mg), Folate (37 µg), Lycopene ( 1830 µg).</p><p><h3>Sodium</h3></p><p><h3>Total Fat</h3></p><h2 class=food-h2>Health Benefits</h2><p>The nutrients found in papaya are thought to have a wide range of health benefits, including protecting against a number of chronic health conditions.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-global.website-files.com/63ed08484c069d0492f5b0bc/6541520228094dba602b24ad_pexels-jess-loiterton-5507735-p-500.webp alt sizes=100vw style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3 class=food-h3>May Have Anticancer Properties</h3><p>Research has suggested that lycopene found in papaya can reduce the risk of cancer.³ Lycopene may also be beneficial for those who are being treated for cancer by reducing free radicals in the human body.⁴&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>In one study, papaya was the only fruit among 14 choices to demonstrate anticancer activity in breast cancer cells.⁵ In another study, researchers found that fermented papaya reduced oxidative damage in older adults with inflammation and precancerous stomach conditions.⁶ However, more research is needed in this area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=food-h3>May Protect Against Skin Damage</h3><p>Due to the high vitamin C and lycopene content in papayas, this fruit can help protect your skin and reduce signs of aging.⁷ In one study, supplementing with lycopene for 10 to 12 weeks decreased skin redness after sun exposure.⁸ In another study, women who consumed a mixture of lycopene, vitamin C, and antioxidants for 14 weeks had a visible and measurable reduction in the depth of face wrinkles.⁹</p><h3 class=food-h3>Powerful Antioxidant Effects</h3><p>Free radicals in the human body promote oxidative stress, which can lead to the development of many chronic diseases. Antioxidants, including the ones in papayas, can neutralize free radicals.¹⁰ Multiple studies note that fermented papaya can reduce oxidative stress in older adults and people with prediabetes, mild hypothyroidism, and liver disease.⁶ ¹¹ ¹² ¹³&nbsp;</p><h3 class=food-h3>May Help Reduce Cognitive Disorders</h3><p>Researchers believe that free radicals in the brain are an important factor in the development of Alzheimer’s disease.¹⁴ In one study, people living with Alzheimer’s were given fermented papaya extract for six months and experienced a 40% drop in a biomarker, indicating oxidative damage to DNA and is linked to aging and cancer.¹⁵ ¹⁶&nbsp;</p><h2 class=food-h2>Is Papaya Good for Weight Loss?</h2><p>Eating papaya may be beneficial for weight loss efforts and weight management as it is low in calories and high in fiber, making papaya a nutrient-rich food.&nbsp;<a href=#>High-fiber foods</a>&nbsp;can help control appetite and reduce cravings, supporting weight loss goals.</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>In one study, fiber intake was said to predict weight loss success regardless of dietary pattern. This means that individuals who eat a high-fiber diet are more likely to achieve weight loss than those who eat less fiber.¹⁷ Adding papaya to your diet may be one way to achieve your daily fiber goals.</p><h2 class=food-h2>Is Papaya Safe for People Living with Diabetes?</h2><p>Papaya is a medium-glycemic index fruit which means it has a relatively lower impact on blood sugar levels than high-glycemic fruits like pineapple and mango. Papaya has a low amount of natural sugar and a higher fiber content, which helps slow down sugar absorption in the bloodstream, improve digestion, and normalize blood sugar levels.&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>When eating papaya, various factors can affect its impact on blood sugar levels, including the ripeness of the fruit, individual diet, health status, and medication usage. Ripe papayas are sweeter and may contain a higher natural sugar content. The fruit may also interact with certain diabetes medications, so it is essential to speak to a healthcare provider if you are concerned about adding papaya to your diet.&nbsp;</p><p>Get more information about weight loss, glucose monitors, and living a healthier life</p><p>Thank you!
