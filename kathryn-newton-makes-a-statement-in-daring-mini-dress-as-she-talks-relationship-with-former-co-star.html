A bold red lipstick completed her Valentines-ready look.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a3f0d156bd09-image002.jpg><p id=e4EEsRC0U3M data-wc=41>During the chat with <a class=hm-link href=#>Drew Barrymore</a>, former child star Kathryn opened up about her time on the hit soap opera, , in which she starred alongside Kelly Ripa, playing her little sister, Colby Marian Chandler, from 2001 to 2004.&nbsp;</p><p id=eXrk9vzlSIK data-wc=31>Drew said to Kathryn: "You do also make families, like the extended family I found on sets. And you were related to Kelly Ripa in the soap opera All My Children."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e8c1d136ed8f-image003-1.jpg><p id=eSZ2YO60ro data-wc=49>She responded: "She played my sister. Jonathan Bennett played my brother; Josh Duhamel played the same character as my brother. And it's so strange when you're little, after they switched these actors out, and Jonathan Bennett wasn't my brother anymore, I still went with him to Toys R Us.&nbsp;</p><p id=erNjGcGWAU data-wc=48>"I was convinced he was my brother and Kelly Ripa was my sister. I know now she's not, and I'm okay...But I do think being on a set, no one understands. Like we're here on your show, and we know you want us to do a good job.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/894f0d82d099-gettyimages-1989609387.jpg><p id=eXhZyo5BCo data-wc=23>"And I feel like that's my experience of being on a set, everyone around me always wanted me to do a good job."&nbsp;</p><p id=ebaZSw6E4x data-wc=34>Kathryn has starred alongside many big names throughout her career over the years, and another of her earliest roles was alongside Cameron Diaz in who she has very fond memories of too.&nbsp;</p><p id=em9DIlS4gN data-wc=53>She recalled to Collider about working with the Hollywood star, telling the publication: "You know what's so cool? [Cameron Diaz] knew that we all wanted a picture with her, because we were like 11 years old, and she hired a photographer, and they printed out the picture, and she signed it for everybody.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ec89c9b27a6a-gettyimages-112487823.jpg><p id=eiZbxdOnP4 data-wc=27>"Not just the leads, like the lead kids. I think she did it for all the extras. Like, what? Superstar! So, I learned a lot from that!"&nbsp;</p><p id=eREwWII949 data-wc=42>Kathryn's latest big role is in eighties-themed horror comedy film Lisa Frankenstein, playing the lead of Lisa, a misunderstood teenager who falls in love with a reanimated corpse, played by Cole Sprouse, who emerges from his grave missing some key body parts.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLlIja_7V6 data-wc=32>The pair go on a killing spree to collect the body parts needed for Cole's alter-ego.
