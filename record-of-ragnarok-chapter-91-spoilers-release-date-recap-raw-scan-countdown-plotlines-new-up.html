The chapter showed how Liu Bei used his secret weapon, the Eight Geniuses, to counter Apollo’s overwhelming power. The Eight Geniuses were the eight loyal advisers and generals of Liu Bei, who sacrificed their lives to become his Volund, the Valkyrie Thrud.</p><p>With their help, Liu Bei was able to unleash a powerful attack called the Eight Formation, which pierced through Apollo’s solar armor and struck his heart. Apollo was shocked and impressed by Liu Bei’s courage and loyalty, and admitted his defeat before falling to the ground. Liu Bei then collapsed as well, having exhausted his life force. The chapter ended with the announcement of the winner of the seventh round: Liu Bei, the first human to defeat a god without dying.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Plotlines_and_Story_of_Record_Of_Ragnarok_Chapter_91></span><strong>Plotlines and Story of Record Of Ragnarok Chapter 91</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The plot of Record of Ragnarok revolves around a fighting tournament between 13 gods and 13 humans, with the fate of humanity in the balance. The gods have decided to exterminate humankind, but the valkyries have proposed to give them one last chance to prove their worth. The valkyries have chosen 13 of the greatest heroes and warriors in human history, and have offered to become their Volund, or divine weapons, to fight against the gods.</p><p>The tournament consists of 13 rounds, and the first side to win seven rounds will be declared the victor.
