Each show is an opportunity for fans to see individual performances by three of their favorite artists and also see them as they join each other on stage to perform some musical surprises. The artists share mutual admiration and respect, but this is the first time that all three have shared a headline tour.</p><p>ALEJANDRO FERNANDEZ</p><p>Mexican superstar Alejandro Fernandez is one of the few Latin singers that enjoys extraordinary success singing both ranchera and pop music.

With 20 studio albums recorded, many which have gone multi-platinum, along with a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and numerous Grammy and Latin Grammy awards and nominations, Fernandez is considered one of the most talented and successful Mexican singers ever.</p><p>JOAN SEBASTIAN</p><p>Producer, Singer songwriter Joan Sebastian is one of the most influential Mexican performers of all time. He is the winner of three Grammy awards, five Latin Grammys, and multiple Latin Billboard awards including a Billboard Hall of Fame. With 37 albums to date, many of which have been certified platinum all over the United States, Mexico and Latin America. Sebastian has been able to maintain a successful, solid career and has also written and produced hundreds of songs for numerous artists, most recently, Alejandro Fernandez. His critically acclaimed jaripeo performances are renowned; last year’s performance at the Staple Center was sold out with over 16,000 people in attendance.</p><p>MARCO ANTONIO SOLIS</p><p>Mexican born Marco Antonio Solis is one of the most important and successful singer-songwriters in Latin music, and his compositions, recorded by himself and covered by scores of other artists, have literally shaped the direction of Latin music in Latin America and the U.S. As the leader of the most influential group of its time, Los Bukis, and as a solo artist, he has recorded over 20 albums and written over 300 songs, had numerous Platinum albums in the United States, Mexico and Latin America, plus had a string of radio hits, many of them having reached the No.1 position on Billboard’s ‘Hot Latin Tracks’ chart, making him one of the few artist who has enjoyed tremendous success in both the pop and regional charts.</p><pre id=pre2 class=pre> Additional tour and ticket information can be found at LiveNation.com.
