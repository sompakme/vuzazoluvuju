Inside His Relationship to Soon Yi</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Where <a href=#>Woody Allen</a> goes, controversy follows. The 82-year-old filmmaker is a divisive person in Hollywood (and everywhere else in the world, tbh). People continue to scratch their heads at the fact that even after his sexual assault allegations, young <a href=#>actresses continue to work with him</a>. But, when he’s not being criminal he’s being downright creepy. A ton people are wondering did Woody Allen actually marry his daughter? And the answer is no. But, he did marry his ex’s daughter.</p><p>And you thought your family had issues… his (basically) former step-daughter Soon-Yi was adopted by his ex-partner, Mia Farrow, and her ex-husband, André Previn in 1976. Mia began dating the filmmaker in 1979 (when Soon Yi was nine) and continued a relationship with him until 1992 when she discovered that he had been having a sexual relationship with her daughter. Even though Woody never adopted Soon Yi or married Mia, he has admitted to being a “paternal figure” to Soon Yi which is creepy AF because the couple married in 1997.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/woody-allen-wife.jpg><p>“I’m 35 years older, and somehow, through no fault of mine or hers, the dynamic worked,” the director <a href=#>told NPR in an interview</a>. “I was paternal. She responded to someone who was paternal. She deferred to me, and I was happy to give her an enormous amount of decision-making just as a gift and let her take charge of so many things. She flourished. It was just a good luck thing.”</p><p>But, despite those sentiments, Soon Yi (and even Woody in other interviews) expressed that he was never a “father figure” to her. “To think that Woody was in any way a father or stepfather to me is laughable,” she told <a href=#>TIME in 1992</a>. “My parents are Andre Previn and Mia, but obviously they’re not even my real parents. I came to America when I was seven. I was never remotely close to Woody.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/woody-allen-soon-yi-kids.jpg><p>Woody and Soon Yi with their daughters.</p><p>Whether Woody and Soon Yi’s relationship is moral depends on the person. But, it definitely upset Mia. Not only did her longterm boyfriend cheat her on… he cheated on her with her daughter. Plus, Woody and Mia share a biological son, Ronan Farrow, and he adopted her kids, Dylan and Moses Farrow.</p><p>In 1993, Mia and Woody began an intense custody battle where <a href=#>he testified about his relationship</a> with Soon Yi, admitting he didn’t think it would negatively impact his children. When the judge asked, “Wasn’t that enough, that you would know that you were sleeping with your children’s sister?” He simply responded “I didn’t see it that way. I’m sorry.”</p><p>Soon Yi and her mother have had an estranged relationship since the affair. She currently lives with Woody and their daughters in NYC.</p><p><strong>For more hot celebrity news, listen to Us Weekly editors dish on top topics & trends with these clips from the Hot Hollywood Podcast!<strong><br><br></strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJom6KcXay8sLDYZpilpJWjeq6t0auwZqCZqHqlrdSgn62domJ%2Bdn6Wb2to</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
