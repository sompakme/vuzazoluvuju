conservatory in Boston, Massachusetts, which offers degrees in music, acting, and dance to study musical theater.&nbsp;She, however, quit after a year to join the cast of&nbsp;</span><span>Spring Awakening</span><span>&nbsp;in Los Angeles .</span></p><h2><strong><span>Kimiko’s parents – Who are they?</span></strong></h2><p><span>They are Mark Glenn (father) and Sumiko Glenn (mother).&nbsp;Her father is of Scottish, German and Irish descent, while her mother is of Japanese descent.&nbsp;Both Mark and Sumiko support their children’s careers from an early age, as Kimiko’s case shows – she started entertaining people when she was ten years old.</span></p><p><span>Amanda Glenn once shared that their parents used to drive them around the Valley when she and Kimiko were kids.&nbsp;Although the professions of Mark and Sumiko are not known to the public, it is believed that the couple raised their children in a comfortable home.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is she dating?&nbsp;Who is her boyfriend?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Kimiko is currently in a relationship with Sean Grandillo, an American musician, singer and actor.&nbsp;The two began their relationship on February 14, 2015 and have remained inseparable ever since.</span></p><p><span>Kimiko Glenn and Grandillo are madly in love with each other.&nbsp;They often profess their love for each other on their social media

however, raised in Aurora, Ohio, where he attended Leighton Elementary School and Aurora High School.</span></p><p><span>Sean also studied musical theater at Ithaca College, but then left the band to

series&nbsp;</span><span>The Real O’Neals,</span><span>&nbsp;where he played the fictional character, Brett Young.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His height and weight</span></strong></h2><p><span>The

is 50 kg (110 lbs).&nbsp;Kimiko has brown hair and brown eyes.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net worth – How rich is Kimiko Glenn?</span></strong></h2><p><span>It is believed that Glenn’s profession puts a reasonable sum in her pocket considering that she is talented and hard working.&nbsp;From her many roles, she has successfully built a net worth of $1 million for herself.&nbsp;As someone who
