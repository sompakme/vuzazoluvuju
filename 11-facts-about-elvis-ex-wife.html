"Even when she lost a tooth, he gave her five bucks," the "Naked Gun" star said at an event for her book, "Elvis and Me,"&nbsp;in 2017 (via&nbsp;<a href=#>Closer Weekly</a>). "I said, 'Look, you can't give her five dollars!'" Elvis replied, "She's Elvis Presley's daughter!"&nbsp;</p><p>However, there was trouble in paradise for the duo. "Elvis kept up his lifestyle," Priscilla said. Even though she tried to ignore Elvis' trysts with other women, the star recalled, "I did know that there was some finagling going on." Priscilla filed for divorce in 1972, and it was finalized a year later. In 1977, Elvis died of cardiac arrhythmia, and a variety of drugs were found in his system later, per <a href=#>PBS News Hour.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Despite their tumultuous relationship, Priscilla has nothing but love for the rock 'n' roll legend.&nbsp;"I&nbsp;lost everything. You have to remember, he was such an impact in my life, in every way. He was my mentor, he was my confidant,"&nbsp;Priscilla told <a href=#>ET</a>, adding, "He was everything. In my book I wrote 'my God,' because I lived and breathed him."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2pmZYN4e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5z6ugrJuZobmiec%2BrnKykla58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
