However, he has been embroiled in quite a bit of controversy and turmoil as of late. Overall, this is due to the fact that he tested positive for PEDs following his fight with Devin Haney. As a result, the win did not count. Furthermore, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Garcia has been suspended for an entire year.</a> This is not good for his career, especially since a loss to Gervonta Davis has already put him on the fringes of irrelevance.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite Garcia's alleged actions,<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> the boxer still carries hatred for Devin Haney</a>. It's peculiar as to why considering Haney has nothing to do with the suspension. Regardless, if Garcia has an opportunity to diss Haney, he is going to take it every single time. That is exactly what happened recently as Garcia was streaming on a yacht with content creator N3on. As you can see below, Garcia gave his own freestyle on top of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kendrick Lamar</a>'s "Not Like Us."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ryan-garcia-spits-bars>Ryan Garcia Spits Bars</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Lyrically, this freestyle was not good. As far as flows go, it also wasn't very good. In the comments section over at No Jumper, fans couldn't help but make fun of Garcia's recent change in demeanor. "His whole demeanor change after the tank fight," one person wrote. "Ryan looks like heâ€™s on coke," said another. Some fans even called N3on corny for entertaining any of this. If anything is for certain, it is that Garcia is not the same fighter he was even just one year ago.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of this freestyle from Ryan Garcia, in the comments section down below.
