We mean <strong>Judge Bieber</strong>, the namesake of Bieber, Calif. Population: 510.</p><p>The small Northern California town is situated in the Big Valley, 250 miles north of Sacramento. Though <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter </a>has seen photographic evidence of the pop star’s fans stopping by the town to take pictures in front of its sign, Bieber residents insist Bieber fever hasn’t quite infected the town.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>PHOTOS: Exclusive Portraits of Justin Bieber With Longtime Manager Scooter Braun</strong></a></p><p>“We really don’t get much Justin Bieber hype,” says <strong>Jessica Bowman</strong>, superintendent/principal of Big Valley Schools. “And due to our rural location, don’t get many visitors at all.”</p><p>Kids grow up zipping around on dirt bikes, hunting, playing after-school sports and heading down to Kathy’s Cafe for cold Cokes. The fire department is unironically adorned with the letters <span>BFD</span> (for <span>Bieber</span> Fire Department, though it has a less family-friendly <a href=# rel=nofollow>Urban Dictionary</a> definition as well.)</p><p>“It’s a great place to live. It’s just clean life,” says <strong>Tom Cox</strong>, who lived in <span>Bieber</span> as a teen and graduated from high school there in 1980.</p><p>In addition to Bieber, Big Valley is made up of three other towns: <span>Nubieber</span>, Lookout and <span>Adin</span>. As idyllic as it sounds, like most parts of the country, the Big Valley has dark parts of its history. In 1901, citizens of Lookout <a href=# rel=nofollow>lynched five men</a> (a father, his three sons and a drifter) for allegedly maiming and killing local ranchers’ cattle and horses.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>THR COVER: Justin Bieber Reveals Will Smith Counsels Him Weekly in Rare, Raw Interview</strong></a></p><p>In some surprising ways, the town’s residents have more in common with a celebrity than one might think. There’s no anonymity walking down the street since everyone knows who you are. And when you go out in Bieber, you often don’t have to pay for anything. Many stores let you run a tab that you pay at the end of the month, because they know you’re good for it.</p><p>And if you’re young and you get in a little trouble with traffic laws, you might get off with a warning. When Cox was 15, the county sheriff pulled him over for driving without a license. Instead of giving him a ticket, the sheriff just followed him back home and told him not to do it again.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Key Statistics:</strong></p><p>Number of Churches: 4</p><p>Number of Schools: 2</p><p>Population: 510 (it was 312 during the 2010 census)</p><p>See a video tour of Bieber below.</p><p></p><p>Email: Aaron.Couch@THR.com<br>Twitter: @AaronCouch</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKO1xJucq2WTlrmqss6rpaKZXai6orjLZquor55iuarCxKxkb21oZYZ1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
