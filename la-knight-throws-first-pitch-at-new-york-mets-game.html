As fans wait to yell “YEAH” back at LA Knight, fans at the baseball game got to see a little bit more of the former Max Dupri.</p><p>LA Knight received the honor of throwing out the first pitch at the New York Mets game today. It was quite a treat for fans at the ballpark, because they might not have realized they were getting to see LA Knight as well.</p><p>Fans at the ballpark yelled “YEAH” at LA Knight, and you can hear that in the video below. It seems that LA Knight had a great time representing WWE today in a much different venue.</p><p>WrestleMania is taking over Philly, and the company doesn’t want anyone to forget it. Obviously, LA Knight will represent WWE in the process, and hopefully he will get a spot on the show of shows as well. They were quick to remind fans in NYC that Philly is getting Mania next year.</p><p>Only time will tell what is next for LA Knight. He had quite a good time today, and odds are those engagements where he puts his face in front of WWE to represent the company won’t come to an end any time soon.</p><p>LA Knight worked hard throughout his entire career, grinding, and doing what he can to get attention. Now that he’s finally doing his thing, and getting a nice push, in WWE, there doesn’t seem to be any limit to what he can do next.
