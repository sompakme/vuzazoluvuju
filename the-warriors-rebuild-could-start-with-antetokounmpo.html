the first round of the playoffs despite finishing the regular season with the best record in the Eastern Conference (58-24).</p><p>With <strong>Giannis Antetokounmpo </strong>third in the MVP race, the team was loaded with talented stars and playoff contenders.</p><p>But they were eliminated by the eighth-ranked <strong>Miami Heat</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>Bucks </strong>reacted immediately by firing their coach, <strong>Mike Budenholzer</strong>, who led the team to a ring in the 2020-21 season, and that move by the franchise generated anger from some players, as the coach was dealing with some terrible personal situations off the court.</p><p>All eyes are now on <strong>Giannis Antetokounmpo</strong>, who still hasn't recovered from the elimination and according to some reports, might feel his chances of winning the ring are better elsewhere.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

the team isn't doing enough to build around him, he could consider other options.</p><p>Milwaukee is a small market compared to other NBA cities, and Antetokounmpo would not look unfavorably on playing for a team with a larger market to increase his exposure and branding opportunities.</p><p>As revealed by <strong>Brian Windhorst</strong>, a reputable ESPN reporter, <strong>Giannis Antetokounmpo</strong>, who ended up very frustrated after the first-round exit to the Heat, could refuse to re-sign with the team this summer.</p><p>"The <strong>Bucks </strong>are facing a very difficult situation this summer because they have guys in their 30s who need to get paid, and they have <strong>Giannis </strong>with a contract extension situation," the journalist explains.</p><p>"It's unlikely the Greek will extend his contract this summer.</p><p>"He's got two years left, with everything that's going on with the team, and the fact that there's new ownership makes it very difficult."</p><p>Possible destinations for <strong>Antetokounmpo </strong>have already begun to emerge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/e00-marca.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2023/05/14/16840494334820.jpg><p><strong>Blazers </strong>star <strong>Damian Lillard </strong>wants the two-time MVP alongside him in Portland.</p><p>But the name that has emerged with more force in recent hours is that of the <strong>Warriors</strong>, that although his coach, <strong>Steve Kerr</strong>, and his star, <strong>Stephen Curry</strong>, do not recognize it, they need a reconstruction to return to opt for the ring and the masterpiece to give a blow to the table and shake the NBA market would be able to get <strong>Giannis Antetokounmpo</strong>.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>An appetizing trade package for the Bucks</h2><p>The operation would not be simple, it would be a large-scale trade whereby the <strong>Warriors </strong>could offer the <strong>Bucks </strong>in exchange for Antetokounmpo a pack that would include <strong>Draymond Green, Andrew Wiggins, Jonathan Kuminga</strong>, a first-round pick in 2023 and a first-round pick in 2025.</p><p>With <strong>Khris Middleton </strong>a free agent, <strong>Brook Lopez </strong>potentially looking for top dollar elsewhere, and <strong>Giannis </strong>seemingly intrigued by the possibility of playing the style of game the <strong>Warriors </strong>employ, this trade could work for both sides.</p><p><strong>Giannis </strong>wants his second NBA championship and joining the <strong>Warriors </strong>could be the best way to accomplish that.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>He would fit in with the Warriors' fast-paced game.</h2><p>The <strong>Golden State Warriors </strong>already have two stars on their team in <strong>Stephen Curry </strong>and <strong>Klay Thompson</strong>, but adding a superstar like Antetokounmpo, the NBA's best physical specimen with averages of 31.1 points, 11.8 rebounds and 5.7 assists, would make them heavy favorites for a ring next season.</p><p>There are few players in the NBA with the Greek's ability to influence a team's play both on defense and offense, where his versatility and speed would allow him to fit into the Warriors' fast-paced game.</p><p>If Giannis does not extend his contract this summer with the <strong>Milwaukee Bucks</strong>, the <strong>Bucks </strong>would consider cashing in with a trade, and the best package would come from the <strong>Warriors</strong>, who can provide two cornerstones of the franchise, two first-round picks and a player in <strong>Draymond Green </strong>that they can keep for a year before his contract expires.</p><p><strong>Giannis </strong>has all the power right now and if he decides not to stay in Milwaukee long-term, the <strong>Warriors </strong>will be on the prowl.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>More physicality, points and defense for Golden State</h2><p>The <strong>Warriors </strong>know they need more physicality, points and defense to get back to their unstoppable level and <strong>Giannis Antetokounmpo </strong>would give them all of that because of his traits and style of play.</p><p>His versatility and his ease to complement with other stars are points in his favor.</p><p>If the <strong>Warriors </strong>can put him together with <strong>Stephen Curry </strong>and <strong>Klay Thompson</strong>, they would become a fearsome team and the main candidates to win the championship.</p><p class=postsid
