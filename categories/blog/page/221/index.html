The model's understated elegance and innate cool makes for an ideal pairing with the wearable luxury brand—and Fall 2013's campaign is no different.

That’s likely changing given his key role in Black Panther, Marvel’s $1.3 billion-grossing juggernaut, although the acclaimed 46-year-old English actor (an Emmy winner for his work on Sherlock) continues to be committed to straddling the line between blockbuster extravaganzas and smaller, more character-driven ventures. <a href=../../../../martin-freeman-on-sherlock-backlash-black-panther-mania-and-his-future-marvel-plans.html>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../../../categories/blog/page/220/index.html>&lt; Prev</a>
