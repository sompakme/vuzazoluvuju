It’s not supporting me being on the court,” Venus Williams said.</p><p>“It’s such a bummer, but I’m going to work on myself and get myself together to be at the US Open,” she said.</p><p>Five days after losing to Zheng Qinwen of China at the Western & Southern Open in Mason, Ohio, Williams had been slated to play her debut match in Cleveland on Monday.</p><p>She defeated No&nbsp;16 Veronika Kudermetova of Russia earlier in her run at&nbsp;the event just&nbsp;outside of Cincinnati, giving her her first victory over a top-20 opponent in four years. After missing nearly six months due to injury, Williams is ranked No&nbsp;407 in the world with a 3-6 record this season.</p><p>The 43-year-old tennis icon&nbsp;has been granted a wild card to the US Open, which starts on 28&nbsp;August. After making it to the final in her first appearance&nbsp;at Flushing Meadows in 1997, Venus Williams&nbsp;won back-to-back championships there in 2000-01.</p><p>US Open organisers are thrilled to have the former champion in the field.</p><p>An announcement reads: “Seven-time Grand Slam singles champion Venus Williams and former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki are at the top of the list of the eight players awarded wild cards into the 2023 US Open women’s singles main draw.</p><p>“They’ll be joined by Americans Ashlyn Krueger, Robin Montgomery, Kayla Day and Clervie Ngounoue, as well as Australia’s Storm Hunter and France’s Fiona Ferro as part of reciprocal wild-card agreements with Tennis Australia and the French tennis federation.</p><p>“This year’s tournament will be Williams’ 24th main draw appearance in Queens, where she won back-to-back titles in 2000 and 2001. Now 43, the former No. 1 missed nearly six months on the court due to injury this year, but made her return during the grass-court season. Never a player to be counted out, Williams clinched her first Top 20 win since 2019 two days ago at the WTA 1000 event in Cincinnati, defeating Veronika Kudermetova in straight sets.</p><p>“Wozniacki, 33, is making her first Grand Slam appearance since retiring after the 2020 Australian Open to start a family. Now with two small children, 2-year-old Olivia and 6-month-old James, the former world No. 1 and 2018 Australian Open champion is returning to the courts where she was the women’s singles finalist in 2009 and 2014.”</p><p>READ MORE: <a href=#>How Serena Williams keeps sister Venus going on the WTA Tour</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHNp6Csa2Zqe6S7zGiurZldqby2vo6vnKeto2LEqrjLopimq12kwrV5zp9knKSVq7Ktrc2dZKKmo57Atb%2BMrJ%2BeZaeeua15z6WYsmWlqHqwvMSn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
