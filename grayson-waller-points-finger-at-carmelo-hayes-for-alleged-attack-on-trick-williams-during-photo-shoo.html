The Australian&nbsp;is now a mainstay of Friday Night SmackDown, but that doesn’t mean he forgot about his time in NXT. In fact, he interrupted Carmelo Hayes’ recent photoshoot and claimed that Hayes attacked Trick Williams.</p><p>The Australian star became one of the biggest heels in NXT thanks to his excellent character work and in-ring psychology during the matches. He also squared off against Carmelo Hayes plenty of times during his time there.</p><p>Trick Williams was attacked on NXT television a couple of months ago and the storyline suggested someone close to him was the attacker. All signs pointed towards Carmelo Hayes, but there was no conclusive proof about him being the attacker. This is despite Hayes displaying actions that hinted at attacking Williams.</p><p>Speculation about the identity of Trick Williams’&nbsp;<a href=#>attacker revealed an interesting name as well</a>. In light of this, Grayson Waller took to Twitter and uploaded a video where he interrupted Carmelo Hayes’ photoshoot and congratulated him on attacking his best friend Trick Williams, stating that even Waller wouldn’t do such a thing. Waller was even wearing a Williams shirt for good measure.</p><p>”Gotta say I’m proud of you man. Talking about you attacking your best friend now. Even Grayson Waller wouldn’t do that and I’ve done some mean things.”</p><p>Carmelo Hayes also started a <a href=#>#JusticeForHayes campaign after the events of NXT this week</a>. We will have to wait and see who will end up being revealed as Trick Williams’ attacker, as all signs point towards one person according to fans – Carmelo Hayes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What do you think of what Grayson Waller had to say?
