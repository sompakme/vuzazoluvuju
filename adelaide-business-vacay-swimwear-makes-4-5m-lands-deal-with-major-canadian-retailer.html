There were expensive ones that would break the bank, or really cheap bad quality ones.</p><p>“That was a bit of a light bulb moment.”</p><p>The pair went on to launch men’s swimwear brand Vacay Swimwear in 2017.</p><p>They barely eked out a living at first while their marketing mates earned big pay cheques.</p><p>But the economic pain ultimately paid off.</p><p>Fast forward six years and Vacay Swimwear made $4.5 million in the last financial year and is on track for the same amount come June.</p><p>Two months ago, they struck a massive deal with a major brick-and-mortar Canadian retailer, Hudson’s Bay, in a move that will see their products widely stocked in North America.</p><p>When Mr Kallios and Mr Decandia returned from their trip, they sunk everything they had into the business venture.</p><p>“We had about $20,000 each, we literally emptied our bank accounts and poured it all into the business. All the money we made is from that initial amount,” Mr Kallios told news.com.au.<br></p><p>Getting Vacay Swimwear off the ground coincided with their final university exams. They were 21 at the time.</p><p>“We were planning Vacay Swimwear, the logos, branding, products, samples, building the website, creating an influencer list, registering our business name, setting up a trademark – we were doing that while we were studying for our last exams,” Mr Kallios said.</p><p>It launched as an online-only platform at first. For the first year of the business, sales were painfully low.</p><p>“We were only making $300 a week when all our marketing mates were raking in $80,000 a year,” Mr Kallios lamented.</p><p>But then things started to take off.</p><p>After two years Vacay Swimwear “started getting the attention” of big brands.</p><p>Their products are now stocked in David Jones department stores and their board shorts are also available to purchase through shopping website The Iconic.</p><p>They also have a large international online presence.</p><p>North America is their biggest market, with Americans and Canadians making up 70 per cent of their overall online sales.</p><p>This is how they were able to score a deal with Canadian department store Hudson’s Bay earlier this year.<br></p><p>In Europe, they have customers in Germany, France, Italy, Belgium and Austria.</p><p>Vacay Swimwear is stocked on an online platform called Zalando, which attracts a lot of European buyers.</p><p>They also sell products in New Zealand.</p><p>Now 28, the pair understand a thing or two more about running a business.</p><p>They get to travel the world for trade shows.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>The duo’s company turned over an eye-watering $1 million in its best month last year, in November, during the Black Friday sales.</p><p>“Given people are being conservative with their spending, lots of people were waiting for the Black Friday, so we forecasted to do a $1 million in sales,” Mr Decandia said. “We planned for eight months, programmed our website to make it achievable, we went all in.”<br></p><p>There are now 10 people who work under them to keep the business ticking along.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Adelaide data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Adelaide</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyjwdKipZ6ro2S%2FpsDAoqNomZSauaK1w55km62jnrumv9JmrZqbka56tMPIpq6emaJiuqK3xKxkbW2dYrmiusOsZJ2dkaF6uLXToWSmmZqkv26vwKeYnaGRo3qzsdOaoKWdomS7psPSZqqtp6KufKWuw3Kda3GWlrKjr5idbJ6eZmeBeYKWcWpxaJGXs3mu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
