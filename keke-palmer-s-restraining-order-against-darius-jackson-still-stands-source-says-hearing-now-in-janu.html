As we began a new month today, curiosity around the co-parent's future has been rising. This afternoon, surprising reports alleged that the former child star postponed the scheduled hearing, with some even suggesting that she <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">dropped the restraining order</a> too. On Friday (December 1) evening, The Shade Room cleared up that gossip with a new statement straight from a source who's said to be very close to Palmer.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"The restraining order that Keke was granted in November remains in full force and effect and will NOT be dropped," they declared. "[She] will continue to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">protect her safety</a> and the safety of Leo above all else." Pressing charges and filing a police report against her ex were her first steps, "[and] the criminal investigation by the police is continuing." According to the insider, Jackson's lawyer isn't available for the original court date, causing them to reschedule for January 2024.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-keke-palmer-is-staying-focused-on-her-and-leodis-safety>Keke Palmer is Staying Focused on Her and Leodis' Safety</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Keke is concerned about her privacy, Leo's privacy, and the privacy of her family," the statement further explains. "Her preference is to resolve the situation privately rather than in open court if possible, but if not possible the hearing remains on the calendar and Keke will stop at nothing to ensure a safe and healthy outcome for herself and Leo."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Darius Jackson obviously isn't shy about expressing himself on social media, though he's maintaining his composure amid all this drama with his co-parent. Around Thanksgiving, we saw the father of one's Instagram fill up with sweet photos of Leo and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his side of the family</a>, who he'll be away from for his first Christmas due to the restraining order.
