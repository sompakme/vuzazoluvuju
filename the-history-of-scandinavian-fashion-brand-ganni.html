Not only is it beloved by well-dressed celebrities such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bella Hadid</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Miley Cyrus</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Emma Chamberlain</a>, but the clothes, shoes, and accessories are also considered to be high-end and luxury without having a hefty price tag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, each time we slip on a Ganni dress or pair of boots from the label, we often wonder about the brand's history. Who is Ganni's designer? When was Ganni founded? Ahead, we're breaking down the answers to these questions and more.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Bella Hadid wearing Ganni boots.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-where-is-the-brand-ganni-from></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Where is the brand Ganni from?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ganni (pronounced&nbsp;GHA-NEE) is a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Danish fashion brand</a>. It was founded by Copenhagen gallerist Frans Truelsen in the year 2000 — although it was far from the label we know and love today. Initially, Ganni was all about creating the perfect cashmere sweater, but in 2009, husband and wife Nicolaj and Ditte Reffstrup took over and set out to scale the company.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Ganni's new owners — as well as CEO (Nicolaj) and creative director (Ditte) — the two began focusing on contemporary ready-to-wear. Instead of leaning toward the traditional Scandinavian style, which is more minimalistic and includes lots of black, Ganni's designs feature playful pops of color and prints, putting a fresh, whimsical take on wardrobe staples.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s all about the contrast; wearing something feminine and pairing it with a pair of sneakers or denim,” Ditte told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Porter</a> in 2018, speaking about their approach. “And, of course, effortless style, because we’re from Copenhagen; everything here seems very laid-back and cool — it’s a very easy way of dressing. For example, we use our bikes every day, and you would never see a girl wearing a pair of heels on her bike, she would always be wearing a pair of sneakers and maybe have her heels in her basket.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This mix of laid-back, yet playful has no doubt helped Ganni develop its cult following. As Nicolaj told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Elle UK</a> when discussing the brand's customers, "It’s them wearing the clothes, not the clothes wearing the girl."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>A metallic outfit by Ganni.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-is-ganni-so-popular></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why is Ganni so popular?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One could argue that Ganni's popularity is due to a variety of factors. For starters, the brand has that unique "cool girl" vibe, inspiring us to pair an easy, breezy dress with a colorful pair of cowboy boots. And it doesn't hurt that Ganni is celebrity-approved. Everyone from Kylie Jenner to Beyoncé has been spotted wearing the clothes, and fashion icons have had Ganni on their favorites list since the mid-2010s.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In January 2015, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>the brand's fall collection</a> was showcased on Vogue as part of its Copenhagen Fashion Week coverage. That same year, Helena Christensen also gave the brand a boost, sharing a photo of herself with Kate Bosworth and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>captioning the pic "#GanniGirls"</a> in reference to their Ganni outfits. By early 2023, the hashtag had been used about 95K times.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">2017 was another pivotal year for Ganni, as the label was acquired by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>LVMH-affiliated private equity firm, L Catterton</a>, for an undisclosed amount. That move helped the brand with its international presence, and today, along with its own stores, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Ganni is sold at 400 premium retailers in 20 countries</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-ganni-a-luxury-brand></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Is Ganni a luxury brand?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ganni is considered to be an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"affordable" luxury brand</a>. While the pieces are elevated and designer quality, they're also fairly priced, with most costing under $1,000 and many falling under $500.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-ganni-fast-fashion></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Is Ganni fast fashion?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ganni is not fast fashion, but on its website, the brand states it's not a sustainable brand, either, since "at its core, fashion thrives on newness and consumption, which is a major contradiction to the concept of sustainability."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Instead, we're focused on becoming the most responsible version of ourselves," reads <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>a section dedicated to responsibility</a>. "We’re not perfect but committed to making better choices every day, minimizing our social and environmental impact across the entire business. We see this as our moral obligation and every action counts. The time to create change is now, no excuses which is why we have committed to an absolute 50% carbon reduction target by 2027."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Each year, Ganni releases <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>responsibility reports</a> to be transparent about its progress. The brand is also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>B Corp certified</a>, which, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>bcorporation.net</a>, is "a designation that a business is meeting high standards of verified performance, accountability, and transparency on factors from employee benefits and charitable giving to supply chain practices and input materials."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Ganni Fall 2023 Collection.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Ganni</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-does-ganni-make-beauty-products></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Does Ganni make beauty products?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ganni entered the beauty space in October 2022, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>collaborating with Submission Beauty</a> on zero-plastic, biodegradable glitter. The products come in three different colors, are made from plant-derived materials, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>cost $25 each</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Ganni's plant-based glitter.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Ganni</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-is-ganni-owned-by></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Who is Ganni owned by?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Today, Ganni is still owned by private equity firm&nbsp;L Catterton, but in June 2022, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Reuters</a> reported that the brand was up for sale.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The firm has hired boutique investment bank Lazard to run the sale process, which has attracted interest from Chinese buyers," the publication wrote, citing "two people with knowledge of the situation" as its sources. At the time Ganni was valued between $500 million and $700 million, however, nothing has been finalized.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x6KqraeirnqwsoygmKemmWKzor%2FHoqanZZKnrq%2BwjHBoaWxpaYQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
