However, with no sign of him on the latest season, Bravo fans are now wondering what happened to him.</strong></p><p>He featured in episodes 1 to 12 of the first series but was fired mid-season for interacting inappropriately with guests, as per <a href=# rel=nofollow>Looper</a>. Before his exit, the Florida native quickly became a fan favorite for his bubbly personality.</p><p>Captain Mark sent Danny home halfway through the season, after he was caught flirting, writing a poem, and kissing a Tilted Kilt model named Morgan during a charter. So where is he now and how does he make an income?</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/04/GettyImages-1125806590-729x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-happened-to-danny-on-below-deck-med>What happened to Danny on Below Deck Med?</h2><p>Danny was fired by Captain Mark after he was thought to be acting inappropriately to charter guests. He was told to leave halfway through <a href=#>Below Deck Mediterranean</a> season 1 after he kissed a Tilted Kilt model named Morgan.</p><p>However, he only got a telling off for this behaviour. The final straw was when Hannah Ferrier discovered the deckhand was showing photos of the Tilted&nbsp;Kilt ladies to other guests, which led to Captain Mark giving him a plane ticket home.</p><p>During the show, he was said to have been offered a salesman position, and has come back on fans‚Äô minds as Below Deck Down Under cast member Benny offers an uncanny resemblance to the former deckhand.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Danny on below deck mediterranean hahahahaha he‚Äôs so funnyüò≠üò≠üò≠ü§£</p>‚Äî lizzie milburn (@lizziemilburnx) <a href=#>January 2, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-deckhand-is-now-a-crypto-investor>The deckhand is now a Crypto investor</h2><p>Danny has since become a Cryptocurrency investor and NFT collector. However, he didn‚Äôt quit yachting after his firing. Shortly after season 1, he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Bravo</a> he continued to explore more of Greece before he ended up on a yacht again.</p><p>He started working in the Caribbean with Below Deck star Aleks Taldykin. After that, Danny pursued a career in acting, as per his <a href=# rel=nofollow>Twitter bio</a> and refers to himself as a viral content creator and life and health coach on his <a href=# rel=nofollow>Twitch</a> page.</p><p>So, aside from his main hobby of investing and collecting NFTs, as declared on his Instagram, his <a href=# rel=nofollow>IMDB page</a> states he has played roles in a handful of video shorts and in a horror dramedy titled ‚ÄúWhat Doesn‚Äôt Kill Us.‚Äù</p><p>Shaquille O‚ÄôNeil, Danny Trejo, Kendrick Lamar, and TikTok and YouTube influencers have featured on his Instagram page, highlighting that Danny is still heavily involved in the world of fame and has several connections!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram">https://www.instagram.com/p/CZkmeKCA88l/</figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-still-miss-danny-zureikat>Fans still miss Danny Zureikat</h2><p>Danny was a marmite cast member on the <a href=#>Bravo series</a>, as viewers either didn‚Äôt like him or thought he was hilarious. Either way, many miss his bubbly personality and drama that kickstarted the beginning of season 1.</p><p>A fan wrote on his <a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a>: ‚ÄúLoved you on Below Deck, just finished S1.
