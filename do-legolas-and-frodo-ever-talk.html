Legolas and Frodo are on the same side, but it doesn't seem as though they were all that friendly with one another.<h2>How many lines did Legolas speak to Frodo?</h2>1 He only spoke to Frodo once in the movies<p>Much of the Lord of the Rings trilogy focuses on Frodo Baggins, but surprisingly enough, Legolas only says one line to the hobbit. In The Fellowship of the Ring, Legolas proudly declares his allegiance to the squad, delivering the single line, “And you have my bow.”</p><h2>What is the only line Legolas said to Frodo?</h2>In fact, there's only one line that Legolas says to Frodo: “And you have my bow.”<h2>Why does Frodo not name Legolas?</h2>This is because Frodo's mind was distracted with the gravity of his mission when he met Legolas so he completely spaced during their introduction. Frodo didn't want to ask during the Fellowship reuniting as it would seem impolite.<h2>Frodo Doesn't Remember Who Legolas is | Cult Popture</h2><p></p><h2>Does Legolas ever talk to Sam?</h2>During the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, Legolas only speaks directly to Frodo once, saying "And my bow." : r/movies.<h2>Why are Legolas eyes blue then brown?</h2>No. Due to technical mishaps involving Bloom's contact lenses, in the films Legolas' eye colour sometimes changes between brown, purple, and blue. (In the director's commentary of the Extended Edition, Peter Jackson admitted that they forgot to put Bloom's contacts in several times.)<h2>Does Legolas ever miss a shot?</h2>Legolas happens to be one of the strongest members of the Fellowship of the Ring. His aim with a bow and arrow is true and never misses.<h2>How many times does Legolas blink?</h2>Trivia (129) The only time Legolas blinks is when he realizes he has been wounded and when Thranduil beheads the orc he is interrogating. This is in keeping with the character, as the only time Legolas blinks in The Lord of the Rings trilogy is when he is strongly surprised.<h2>Why does Legolas look different in the Hobbit?</h2>Due to technical mishaps involving Bloom's contact lenses, in the films Legolas' eye colour sometimes changes between brown, purple, and blue. (In the director's commentary of the Extended Edition, Peter Jackson admitted that they forgot to put Bloom's contacts in several times.)<h2>How old is Legolas?</h2>Legolas was portrayed by Orlando Bloom. In the "official movie guide" for The Lord of the Rings, a birthdate for Legolas is set to 87 of the Third Age. This would make him 2931 years old at the time of the War of the Ring.<h2>Is Legolas a dark Elf?</h2>Legolas was a Sindarin Elf who was part of the Fellowship of the Ring in the Third Age. Son of the Elvenking Thranduil of Mirkwood, Legolas was Mirkwood's prince, a messenger, and a master archer.<h2>What happens to tauriel after Kili dies?</h2>Tauriel's fate<p>Tauriel was banished from Mirkwood by Thranduil, so what happens to Tauriel after the Battle of Five Armies remains unknown, although actress Evangeline Lilly stated in an interview that Tauriel returns to Mirkwood.</p><h2>Did Gandalf know Bilbo had the ring?</h2>At the end of The Hobbit, Gandalf reveals to Bilbo that he knows about his magic ring. Here's why the scene doesn't contradict The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf's knowledge of Bilbo's ring in The Hobbit doesn't create a Lord of the Rings plot hole.<h2>What happens to Legolas at the end of Lord of the Rings?</h2>After Aragorn's death, Legolas made a ship in Ithilien and left Middle-earth to go over the sea. His strong friendship with Gimli prompted Legolas to invite him to accompany him to the Undying Lands; making him the first and only Dwarf to do so. He was never seen again in Middle-earth.<h2>What makes Legolas special?</h2>Commentators have noted that Legolas serves as a typical Elf in the story, demonstrating more-than-human abilities such as seeing further than anyone else in Rohan and sensing the memory of a long-lost Elvish civilisation in the stones of Hollin.<h2>Who was Legolas mom?</h2>Legolas' Mother is a posthumous heroine in The Hobbit film series. Apart from several mentions in the third and final film of Peter Jackson's film series, there is no mention of her in any of Tolkien's works and was created solely for the movie.<h2>Do Legolas and Tauriel get together?</h2>He Abandoned Romance For Friendship<p>Loving Tauriel was a particularly harrowing event for Legolas. So much so, in fact, that he never shows any interest in romance ever again. He never even talks about romance in The Lord of The Rings trilogy.</p><h2>Why does Legolas not sink in snow?</h2>I'm sure someone will come along with canon sources - but elves have a special relationship with nature, and pass lightly through Middle Earth - so it is that Legolas is able to tread lightly on the snow that the others (including the Hobbits) sink into.<h2>Does Legolas ever get hurt?</h2>Legolas, the archer, being wounded by an arrow. Ironic perhaps? It also makes sense that the orcs would be aiming primarily for the archer who is shooting their fellow orcs down left and right. A wounded Legolas travelling to Lorien, finding comfort there, etc.<h2>Why did Legolas miss at Helm's Deep?</h2>(or whatever the height of the walls at Helms Deep may be) The answer is simply that you have not seen Legolas attempt a shot that is this difficult and it is beyond his skill level to accurately make that shot to within a 1" grouping like he usually does.<h2>Is Legolas older than Gandalf?</h2>Gandalf has a younger form in Middle-Earth who is appeared to be about 60 but in reality he is 2019 making him older than Middle-Earth. Legolas was not born in TA 87, that date was made up for a reference book to the films.<h2>How tall is Legolas?</h2>Gandalf is 5'6", Legolas is 6', Boromir and Faramir are 6'4", Aragorn is 6'6", Elendil is 7'11" (even the NBA would call him a cheater), Celeborn and Galadriel are 6'4", Thingol is 8'2" (take THAT, Elendil, you little pipsqueak), and Bilbo is 3'6".<h2>Why is Galadriel dark?</h2>During their meeting, Galadriel considered accepting the One Ring when Frodo offered it to her. Then, all of a sudden, she was changed into a terrifying "dark form" that could easily conquer Middle-earth with the Ring's power.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8OoZKWdl6S5or%2BMmqWdZZanvKW7jJ6tnqpdqa6ttw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
