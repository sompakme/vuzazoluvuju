Charter CEO Chris Winfrey <a href=#>framed the dispute</a> at the time as a make-or-break moment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“We’re on the edge of a precipice. We’re either moving forward with a new collaborative video model, or we’re moving on,” Winfrey said at the time. “This is not a typical carriage dispute. It’s significant for Charter, and we think it’s even more significant for programmers and the broader video ecosystem.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Ultimately, after a couple of weeks, the companies <a href=#>reached a new deal</a>, one that will see Disney+ bundled into Charter’s core video offering, but will also see the removal of a number of Disney’s cable channels, including Freeform, Disney Junior and Disney XD.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Dana Walden, co-chair of Disney’s entertainment division, <a href=#>acknowledged that</a> the company “made some trade-offs” in the dispute, but argued that the deal will lead to the best outcome for the company by giving it a glide path to a profitable streaming business.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">And Winfrey, on the earnings call, said that the company intends to pursue similar deals with other programmers.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“We plan to modernize all of our distribution agreements upon renewal in a way that works for customers,” Winfrey said. “That means packaging flexibility, value and not asking customers or us to pay twice for similar DTC and linear programming. As programmers insist on customers paying twice, we just won’t carry those channels. But you know, we’d still be happy to sell their content in an à la carte app the same way as they do. Our goal is to modernize these agreements quietly and seamlessly for mutual customer base.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Charter and Comcast also <a href=#>rolled out</a> their Xumo platform earlier this month, planning to use it as a new focal point for video content.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Charter reported revenue of $13.6 billion in the quarter, up 0.2 percent year over year, and net income of $1.3 billion. The higher revenue was driven by an increase in both Internet and mobile customer relationships.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“We continue to make significant progress against the multiyear strategic initiatives we outlined last year,” said Winfrey in a statement. “These initiatives drive continuing improvements in the quality of our products, and when combined with our customer-friendly pricing and packaging and high-quality service, will drive significant, long-term growth in shareholder value.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmnKCRp8GmvoyqamZqYGeAbrHAq6WippeoeqW10qecsmWUnsCxwdOeZJyto6m8rrHRZqOoq6OawG59kWxsb2ppbIJ1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
