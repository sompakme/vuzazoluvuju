Since 2007, Regal has been paid roughly $1.3 billion, with an average annual payment of $58 million from 2015 to 2019.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The deal, however, was endangered by Cineworld’s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.&nbsp;In 2022, NCM sued Regal Cinemas for <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/regal-owner-cineworld-bankruptcy-national-cinemedia-lawsuit-1235248616/>allegedly exploiting parent </a>company&nbsp;<a href=#>Cineworld</a>’s bankruptcy proceedings to breach its legally-binding advertising deal with the company.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The in-cinema advertising network claimed Regal was looking to rewrite the agreement for better terms, enter into a new agreement with a competitor or bring in-house advertising services. In April, NCM itself filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and struck a debt restructuring deal with lenders to strengthen its balance sheet.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">NCM’s business was hit by the shutdown of cinemas due to the COVID pandemic, followed by the slow industry recovery since the reopening of theaters and advertising being affected by macro-economic clouds.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Now, in the latest chapter in NCM and Cineworld’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, the in-theater advertising firm has hammered out a new deal with Regal, contingent on parent Cineworld emerging from bankruptcy court proceedings in Texas.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“The agreement we announced today strengthens and deepens NCM’s 20-year relationship with Regal Cinemas well into the future and reaffirms our position as the market leader and premier company in cinema advertising,” Tom Lesinski, CEO of NCM, said in a statement.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The agreement also marks another milestone in NCM restructuring its own business coming out of the pandemic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmq52Xlrlur8innKaZo2K7osDIqKWapF2Ytq%2BxzJ6bopldZn90gZRpbmtraGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
