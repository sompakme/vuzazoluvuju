We recommend you keep the silver, as it’s a lot and can be spent on new weapons, gear or customisation items.</p><h2>Should I give the silver to the merchants or fund the war?</h2><p>You can choose to give the silver back to the merchants of the town or use it to fund Halfdan’s war. We chose to give it to the merchants because they deserve it after being cheated by the Needle. This concludes this quest.</p><h2>Who is the best person to give the silver too?</h2><p>Ultimately, players should either keep the money, give it to the brother, or give it to the King’s wife, as these are the only ways that players will get anything out of a choice that otherwise doesn’t matter.</p><h2>Who should Eivor give the silver too?</h2><p>The only good options are Gwriad (loot the silver), Angharad (get a gift later), and keeping it. We recommend you keep the silver, as it’s a lot and can be spent on new weapons, gear or customisation items.</p><h2>Who To Give The Silver To In Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</h2><h2>Who killed Ceolbert?</h2><p>After you discover it was actually Ivarr that killed Ceolbert in an attempt to frame King Rhodri and usurp him from the throne, you’ll enter into a boss battle against Ivarr. He’s incredibly nimble, and will regularly counteract your stun attacks, so be prepared to dodge for your life.</p><h2>Is Ivarr a bad guy?</h2><p>Ivar Ragnarsson has earned his place as one of TV’s most anger-inducing villains. He was the main antagonist in the fifth season of Vikings where he did plenty of damage. Ivar is the youngest son of Ragnar Lothbrok and Aslaug. It is his father who nicknamed him “Ivar The Boneless.”</p><h2>Is Ivarr a traitor?</h2><p>We chose to say as a coward since Ivarr is a traitor. The outcome will basically be the same no matter what dialogue option you select. The last thing to do is climb up the tower behind you and light the brazier. This concludes this quest.</p><h2>Who betrayed Eivor?</h2><p>The traitor is Galinn. He wanted Soma out of his way to fulfill the true fate he has seen in his deluded visions. He disagrees with her ways. He was far away from other people in the village when the attack happened — without an alibi — and he is quick to blame Lif, and his longship is painted yellow.</p><h2>Did Randvi cheat on Sigurd?</h2><p>Does Randvi cheat on Sigurd? If Sigurd finds out about the affair, he will be less likely accompany Eivor in the “good ending.” So while it is technically Randvi doing the adultery, this indiscretion can actually have a massive impact on Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s story.</p><h2>Is Eivor the son of Odin?</h2><p>Rather, Eivor is a reincarnation of Odin, who instead of being a literal Norse deity is an Isu in the larger Assassin’s Creed mythology.</p><h2>Why does Basim betray Eivor?</h2><p>His campfire story wasn’t from the reality of the 9th century, it was from the eons before when they were Isu. It transpires that Basim is the reincarnation of Loki in Eivor’s Norse Isu past, meaning that he wants his fellow Isu dead in revenge for their treatment of his son.</p><h2>Should I say Ivarr died a warrior?</h2><p>You can tell Halfdan that his brother either died a warrior or a coward. We chose to say as a coward since Ivarr is a traitor. The outcome will basically be the same no matter what dialogue option you select.</p><h2>Why does Dag hate Eivor?</h2><p>As Sigurd spent most of his time in England away from Ravensthorpe, Dag found himself forced to obey Eivor and grew increasingly frustrated with his current predicament. Dag believed that Eivor only sought glory for herself rather than for their jarl, and was therefore very vocal about his disapproval of her rule.</p><h2>What are the 5 choices in AC Valhalla?</h2><p>List of major story choice missions in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</p><ul><li>Seas of Fate – Take or leave resources.</li><li>The Stench of Treachery – Who is Soma’s traitor?</li><li>Heavy Is the Head – Kill or spare Leofrith.</li><li>A Fury from the Sea – Kill or spare Rued.</li><li>Blood from a Stone – Punch Basim or take a breath.</li></ul><h2>Why is Eivor not a man?</h2><p>While female Eivor is the canonical version, the game explains the character’s diverging genders. It explains that the system is thrown off by the presence of Odin’s DNA in Eivor’s bloodline, leading the Animus to occasionally interpret Eivor’s appearance as a male who resembles Odin.</p><h2>Is Sigurd a bad person?</h2><p>Sigurd is the worst leader to have existed in the AC universe for the simple fact that he can’t look beyond himself. TLDR; Sigurd is rude, ignorant, and should have been nicer to Eivor.</p><h2>Who is the main villain in Valhalla?</h2><p>Ubisoft is taking a risk by turning the main villain of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Basim, into the protagonist of Assassin’s Creed Mirage. Mirage will be a prequel to Valhalla, set in Bagdad twenty years before the events of the previous game, showcasing a younger version of Basim.</p><h2>Who all can Eivor sleep with?</h2><ul><li>Pierre. Pierre appears at the beginning of The Siege of Paris DLC as a visitor to Ravensthorpe. …</li><li>Ciara. Ciara is an Irish poet Eivor meets during the Wraths of the Druids’ main story. …</li><li>Bil. The first character you will have a chance to interact with romantically is a woman named Bil. …</li><li>Broder. …</li><li>Stowe. …</li><li>Petra. …</li><li>Gunlodr. …</li><li>Tewdwr.</li></ul><h2>Who should Eivor fall in love with?</h2><p>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s romance options give Eivor the chance to grow close with many different NPCs, but the best choice is the hunter Petra.</p><h2>Should I say Ivarr was wrong or right?</h2><p>Choose any option you’d like here as the outcome doesn’t change much — we chose the one that says what Ivarr did doesn’t matter any longer. This will conclude the quest. After finishing this quest, you’ll receive two new quests: Ransacking Wenlocan and The Supply Line.</p><h2>Can you save Ceolbert AC Valhalla?</h2><p>Is Ceolbert dead AC Valhalla? Tragically, Ceolbert is killed in an ambush and the only evidence that Eivor has is a dagger with the crest of the Britons.</p><h2>Who is weak to silver?</h2><p>Vampires, Werewolves, and other were-creatures are specifically vulnerable to silver, taking more damage from silver weapons.</p><h2>Can we gift silver to anyone?</h2><p>You may. Gold or silver gifts may be subject to gift taxes, depending upon the value of your gift and other factors. Recipients of precious metals gifts may also need to pay capital gains taxes if they sell the gold or silver at a future date.</p><h2>Is there a way to keep Ceolbert alive?</h2><p>Firstly, there is no way that you could have saved Ceolbert, he’s just sadly one of the poor casualties of your quest for peace in Sciropescire.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWWlr5ww8eoZK2nXZi1sLvSnmStp12ctrexjKygpa6Vp3q1u4yipWaZk2LDorjHmqOlmV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
