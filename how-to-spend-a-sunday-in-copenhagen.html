Get up and out early and it will be just you and the odd jogger or lone cyclist sharing the sleepy city-centre streets, allowing you to appreciate the architectural details you would normally miss and wander along Nyhavn without having to navigate the usual crowds.&nbsp;</p><p>When the weather is cold, Sunday morning is a time for Copenhageners to meet friends and hunker down over brunch in cosy, candlelit cafés that are the very definition of hygge, or pile on the layers for a bracing stroll around the lakes that hug the western side of the city. In summer, people gravitate towards the waterfront, soaking up the sun on urban beaches, diving into the harbour baths and taking to boats and kayaks for a leisurely pootle along the&nbsp;canals. Of course, Covid restrictions are disrupting everything for now – but once lockdowns are lifted and everything is opened up, these are Sunday pleasures we can look forward to enjoying.&nbsp;</p><h3>Got the brunchies?</h3><p>Copenhageners fully embrace the idea of Sunday brunch, and there are plenty of places where you can happily graze your way through the morning. At long-time favourite Wulff & Konstali (various venues; <a href=# rel=nofollow>wogk.dk/en/home</a>; 9am-3pm), you create your own perfect brunch, picking five or seven items from a menu of 23 dishes, including fried eggs and veggie salads, apple crumble and poppy seed waffles. Relative newcomer The Sixteen Twelve, on one of Copenhagen’s trendiest streets (Jægersborggade 8; <a href=# rel=nofollow>sixteentwelve.dk</a>, 8am-3.45pm), is inspired by Melbourne’s brunch-café scene and has a supremely health-conscious menu filled with gut-friendly dishes, most of which are made from scratch in-house, whether it is yogurts and granola or brioche and sourdough.&nbsp;</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Eggs Benedict at&nbsp;The Sixteen Twelve</span></figure><p>The ultimate Sunday brunch spot, though, has to be Marchal at Hotel d’Angleterre (Kongens Nytorv 34; <a href=# rel=nofollow>dangleterre.com</a>; 12-3pm). People book months in advance for the chance to sample this grandest of spreads, complete with plump Danish oysters, caviar-topped blinis and cakes flecked with gold leaf.&nbsp;</p><h3>Now walk it off</h3><p>Frederiksberg Have (<a href=# rel=nofollow>kongeligeslotte.dk</a>), designed in the informal English style, is one of the city’s loveliest parks and a popular spot for locals, who seem blasé about the presence of red squirrels and surprisingly tame herons. Wander the winding paths through the woodland and along the waterways, wave to the elephants in the next-door zoo and laze on the lawns in front of the baroque Frederiksberg Castle, bordered by 300-year-old linden trees.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Frederiksberg Castle</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Getty</span></figure><p>On the eastern side of the park is the tranquil Garden Society’s Garden (<a href=# rel=nofollow>haveselskabet.dk</a>); to the south there is more green space to explore in nearby Sondermarken, a scenic park that is home to Cisternerne (<a href=# rel=nofollow>cisternerne.dk</a>), a subterranean reservoir turned unconventional arts&nbsp;venue. Alternatively, head north of the city centre to Kastellet, a star-shaped, 17th-century fortress, where the path around the grassy ramparts, with views over moat and harbour, is a popular spot for a morning stroll or jog.&nbsp;</p><h3>Pretty as a picture</h3><p>All the cultural big hitters are open on Sundays, and the out-of-town Louisiana (<a href=# rel=nofollow>louisiana.dk</a>) is a particularly popular destination. The crowds can make it difficult to appreciate fully the contemporary art exhibits and scenic location, though, so save that one for a quieter weekday and head for some of the city centre’s lesser-known galleries instead – there are some little beauties that you can enjoy in relative peace.</p><p>Hidden away behind the mighty SMK (<a href=# rel=nofollow>smk.dk</a>), Denmark’s national gallery, is the more intimately scaled Hirschsprung Collection (<a href=# rel=nofollow>hirschsprung.dk</a>; 11am-4pm), where Danish art from the 19th and early 20th centuries is displayed in a series of elegant, well-lit rooms. From here it’s a 15-minute stroll via pretty Kongens Have to the David Collection (<a href=# rel=nofollow>davidmus.dk</a>; 10am-5pm), home to one of the world’s most important collections of Islamic art and artefacts. Or head to Slotsholmen, where the decor of Thorvaldsens Museum (<a href=# rel=nofollow>thorvaldsensmuseum.dk</a>; 10am-5pm) is as much of an attraction as its exhibits, the works of 19th-century sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen.</p><h3>Music maestro</h3><p>One of the many joys of Tivoli Gardens (<a href=# rel=nofollow>tivoli.dk</a>) is the programme of music and dance events that take place on its indoor and outdoor stages throughout the day. From rock to jazz, contemporary dance to classical ballet, there is always something going on – and, in summer, every chance of spotting the Tivoli Youth Guard, a bearskin-wearing junior marching band, parading through the park. Look out for the Royal Life Guards, who march through the city centre on their way to the changing of the guard at Amalienborg Palace at noon; if the queen is in residence they’re accompanied by a full band.&nbsp;</p><h3>Market forces</h3><p>The twin glass market halls of Torvehallerne (Frederiksborggade 21, <a href=# rel=nofollow>torvehallernekbh.dk</a>) are perfect for Sunday morning mooching, with a mixture of indoor and outdoor stalls selling all kinds of gourmet goodies. Pull up a stool to eat and drink in (everything from coffee, pastries and porridge to pizzas and pulled-duck baguettes) or pick up supplies for a cut-above picnic – artisan Danish cheeses at Arla Unika, photogenic open sandwiches at Hallernes Smorrebrod and, in season, summer berries from Rokkedyssegard’s pop-up stall in the courtyard between the buildings.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Smørrebrød&nbsp;at&nbsp;Torvehallerne</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Getty</span></figure><p>If you are after something more permanent, check out the flea markets. Open on alternate weekends, B&W Loppemarked (Refshalevej 163, <a href=# rel=nofollow>storebaelt-antik.dk</a>) is the place to hunt for midcentury modern furniture, while Vera’s Market (Bispeengen 12,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>verasvintage.dk</a>; March-Dec, 10am-3pm) is dedicated to making fashion shopping more sustainable, with stalls selling recycled clothes and accessories.</p><h3>Something spiritual</h3><p>Up near the Little Mermaid is the Gothic Revival St Alban’s (Churchillparken 11, <a href=# rel=nofollow>st-albans.dk</a>), a little piece of England adrift in the Danish capital. It was built in the 19th century to serve the growing Anglican community and designed by Victorian church architect Sir Arthur Blomfield to look as English as possible. Prominent British names supplied some of the interior furnishings – Doulton contributed the reredos, pulpit and font, and there are oak pews donated by Thomas Cook & Son. The service (in English) starts at 10.30am. Services at Frederiks Kirke, better known as the Marble Church (Frederiksgade 4, <a href=#>marmorkirken.dk</a>), start at 10.30am and are in Danish only.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>St Alban’s Church</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Getty</span></figure><h3>If you do nothing else…&nbsp;</h3><p>… take the harbour ferry to Refshaleoen, a former shipyard area that’s filled with recreational fun at weekends, including Copenhot’s hot tubs and Lopanoramic saunas (<a href=# rel=nofollow>copenhot.com</a>), avant-garde art at Copenhagen Contemporary (<a href=# rel=nofollow>copenhagencontemporary.org</a>) and the street food and stalls of Reffen (<a href=# rel=nofollow>reffen.dk</a>).</p><p><strong>For more ideas and information, see our online guide to Copenhagen at <a href=# rel=nofollow>telegraph.co.uk/tt-copenhagen</a>&nbsp;and our pick of the <a href=#>best hotels in Copenhagen</a>.</strong></p><p><strong>Overseas holidays are currently subject to restrictions.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKyilsOmuI6am6%2Bhk5p8tLzEp5tmq6WjsaLFjJymqZ2ena6osc1o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
