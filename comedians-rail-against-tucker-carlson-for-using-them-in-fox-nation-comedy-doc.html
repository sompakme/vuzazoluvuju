Carlson’s project seems to focus, as one might guess, on how censorship and cancel culture are killing comedy. It’s unclear from the program’s trailer, however, who exactly Carlson interviewed for this special. And now, at least two comedians whose footage appeared in the trailer appear to have called Carlson out on Twitter for using their likeness without permission.</p><p>The trailer opens on a brief moment from comedian Troy Bond’s <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>stand-up</a> in which a heckler calls his joke racist, but it does not appear Bond is happy about the inclusion. In a quote tweet of the trailer posted Tuesday, he wrote, “Hey<a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#> @TuckerCarlson</a> go fuck a green M&M you open mouthed dipshit. It’s funny that you are making a documentary about comedy considering the right wing has no idea how to do it. You used my clip (without permission) and I will now be joining ANTIFA in retaliation.”</p><p>Comedian and television writer Nimesh Patel appears in the Death of Comedy? trailer for only a brief moment as well. In a video clip from an interview he gave Joe Rogan, Patel describes someone’s belief he was not “entitled” to make a certain joke. On Tuesday, Patel tweeted his belief that Carlson’s special is “nonsense.”</p><p>In a <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>direct reply to Carlson</a> that opened with “Hey clown,” Patel wrote that Carlson “only used my Rogan clip because I said no to your producers.”</p><p>“Comedy is thriving,” Patel wrote in a <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>quote tweet</a> of the trailer from his verified account. “There was a reason I didn’t do<a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#> @TuckerCarlson</a> back 2018 - no one here is a martyr for comedy. Everyone featured in this trailer is selling out theaters and making $$$, myself included. Stop this fake victim BS.” In a <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>follow-up tweet</a>, Patel wrote that Carlson “is a loser. Whining about cancel culture while making millions spewing loosely veiled propaganda. Get off your own dick Tucker.”</p><p>Other comedians, meanwhile, pointed out that Carlson’s documentary seemed to focus almost entirely on white, male comedians. “I guess comedy does seem dead when you only talk to male comics,” long-time Conan writer Laurie Kilmartin <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>tweeted</a>, while <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>stand-up comedian Jena Friedman</a> <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>added</a>, “My heart goes out to any comics who inadvertently ended up in this.”</p><p>Carlson is, as we know, a great champion against cancel culture. His <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>battle for the green M&M’s sex appeal</a>, as cited by Bond, quickly became one of the most ridiculous and regrettable pop culture controversies of 2022. Earlier this year, M&M’s staged a PR stunt that poked fun at Carlson’s meltdown, “revealing” that Maya Rudolph had stepped in to replace the embattled M&M’s spokescandies. The saga just culminated with a <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Super Bowl “press conference”</a> that saw the spokescandies reinstated after Rudolph botched the job.</p><p>Something tells us we will not see Rudolph in Carlson’s special—but if she’s ever desperate, she can always fire up the ol’ LinkedIn and apply for a freelance comedy gig with <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Gutfeld!</a> We’re sure they’d be very lucky to have her, especially since comedy might be dying.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfmLyuscOimKerXaeuqriMmp6aoZ6owW7A1JyinqpdmK6zuNKopWaen6d6tr%2FIp55mrJiaum61zWadqLBdo661tc6nZJynnZqxunnDqJo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
