While this isn't wholly inaccurate, all of those artists followed a blueprint that came into existence quite suddenly thanks to ... well, basically, a couple of dudes who thought they were better than all the rest of the MCs. As it turned out, they were right.</p><p>Before 1986, rap flow was very simple rhythmically and poetically, with monosyllabic rhymes dropped on or about the final downbeat of every measure. That came to a crashing halt with the release of two records that year: "Criminal Minded," the debut album from Bronx crew Boogie Down Productions and its prodigiously gifted MC KRS-One, and the single "My Melody/Eric B. is President" by Eric B. and Rakim. Rappers and listeners alike had never heard anything quite like the rapid-fire, machine-gun flow of BDP's album opener "Poetry," nor the complex, internal and multisyllabic rhyme schemes of Rakim, which he delivered with a disarmingly relaxed flow that many critics have noted resembles a jazz saxophonist (via <a href=#>Complex</a>). In the years immediately following, rappers like Juice Crew members Kool G Rap and Big Daddy Kane would follow their lead, in turn influencing all of those wordsmiths of the mid-to-late '90s. But, as Kane himself made clear in an <a href=#>interview</a> with radio station Power 105.1, the "top three rappers" of his era were KRS, Rakim â€” and himself, of course.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCElmptb25fmbK1rcilqmaZkqTCtXnToZxmn5%2Bhsaa6jJqenmWfm3qzrc9mq6GZpGKxqrDNrWShmaClsq95y6KinmWppMJuwMeipaRn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
