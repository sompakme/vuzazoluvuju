I was at the point where I was in the middle of trying to figure out what I was doing with music and acting. And it had become kind of difficult to maintain both at the same time. &nbsp;</p><p id=eEguZ3TNkdkF data-wc=56>“And I didn’t know what direction I wanted to go, and then I got a DM from [Rihanna] almost right after I was thinking about that situation. She sent one of the videos I had put on my IG. She said that I had a great voice, and I was like, ‘Wow, I appreciate that, Queen.’”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="7 stars who were forced to leave TV shows: From Chicago Fire's Rome Flynn to Castle's Stana Katic & more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0c77b335810b-rome-flynn-stana-katic-daniel-dae-kim.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="7 stars who were forced to leave TV shows: From Chicago Fire's Rome Flynn to Castle's Stana Katic & more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>7 stars who were forced to leave TV shows: From Chicago Fire's Rome Flynn to Castle's Stana Katic & more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Chicago Fire's new star Michael Bradway: From career to famous girlfriend, all to know amid major season 12 cast change" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/a5ff4206550f-michael-bradway-chicago-fire-cast.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Chicago Fire's new star Michael Bradway: From career to famous girlfriend, all to know amid major season 12 cast change" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Chicago Fire's new star Michael Bradway: From career to famous girlfriend, all to know amid major season 12 cast change</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=efipmNY9cQgL data-wc=68>He added: “I started doing music before acting came about, but acting just took off on its own, so I kind of put it aside until I had the time and space to revisit it again.
