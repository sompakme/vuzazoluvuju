Being part of AEW, they are aware of all the drama that went down in the past year. Due to all the drama surrounding CM Pun and Young Bucks, it appears an FTR vs Young Bucks rematch will not be denied.</p><p>CM Punk drew the ire of fans and pro wrestlers alike thanks to his rant after AEW All Out last year and the subsequent backstage brawl with The Elite. This ended up ruining AEW’s reputation in a big way, but the company has recovered.</p><p>As previously reported, <a href=#>Tony Khan stated that CM Punk is positive influence in the company</a>. It is also a known fact that Punk and FTR are very close in real life and they have supported Punk throughout the drama.</p><p>While speaking on&nbsp;<a href=#>Wrestling Observer Radio</a>, Dave Meltzer talked about whether CM Punk’s issues with The Young Bucks would prevent a rematch between FTR and The Young Bucks. Meltzer noted that the drama won’t affect a potential rematch in the future.</p><p>“FTR and Omega, the Young Bucks, they’re all fine. Some people think it’s like this divide with Punk and FTR against these guys.</p><p>With Punk, there’s still fence mending that needs to be done for them to work together and everything like that. It could happen, it may not happen, time will tell.</p><p>But with FTR, it’s fine. There’s nothing at all that would hold up if they wanna do a tag team title program at some point, you know, (hypothetically) tomorrow, everyone’s cool with that.</p><p>FTR worked really hard on that too. They went out of their way to get that done. There was stuff there of course, but it was not nearly as bad of an issue as it was with Punk. It was much easier to mend, so that’s all taken care of.”</p><p>Even Eddie Kingston made it clear <a href=#>the AEW locker room isn’t bothered by CM Punk’s return</a>. We will have to wait and see when AEW will decide to book FTR vs The Young Bucks once again.</p><p>What’s your opinion on this story? Do you want to see FTR vs The Young Bucks again?
