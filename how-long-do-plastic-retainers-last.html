Cracks and dents in the plastic material are the most common signs of retainer wear. Once these cracks or dents are big enough, they'll diminish the strength of your retainers.<h2>How often should you replace your plastic retainer?</h2>A retainer is in the mouth for 6-8 hours nightly. Therefore, we recommend you replace your retainer as often as your toothbrush. Retainer Club offers plans to replace your retainers every 4,6, or 12 months. For the best performance and cleanliness, you should replace your retainers as often as your toothbrush.<h2>How long does the average retainer last?</h2>The lifespan of each depends on how well you take care of your mouth and the retainer.

Talk to a dentist or orthodontist (you can even get multiple opinions) about the options for your dental goals and needs, to see what's right for you.<h2>Do orthodontists keep retainer molds?</h2>Do Orthodontist Keep Retainer Molds? In the case of removable retainers, patients can call their orthodontist and ask that a new one be made, as all good orthodontist will keep patients molds over the period of treatment, something that can not always be said for online providers.<h2>Can I go two weeks without my retainer?</h2>Rule of thumb is: you have to wear your retainers for as long as you want them to be straight.

However, this is not the case. Braces or retainers contribute to bad breath just as much as normal teeth do.

There might be bacteria on it that could cause you to become ill.<h2>Can wearing retainer move teeth back?</h2>As we discussed before, retainers can't move teeth back into place.

These are formed to cover your teeth completely while sitting above your gum line. Most individuals tend to prefer these types of removable retainers as these are less noticeable in comparison to the bonded wire retainers.<h2>Why shouldn't I get a permanent retainer?</h2>Permanent retainers add a little extra time for flossing since the retainer is attached between the teeth.
