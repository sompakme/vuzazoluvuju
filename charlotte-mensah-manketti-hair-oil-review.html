Like, I've-been-hooked-on-it-for-years-it's-my-wash-day-day-one type good. However, this new oil I tried a few weeks ago just kicked my go-to product's ass — big time. And as much as I kinda hate to say it, sis may have just been replaced.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This new oil not only gives my hair the same slip and shine as my OG fave, but the fragrance — girl, girlllllll. It's divine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Charlotte Mensah, I am so glad your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Manketti Hair Oil</a> came into my life because it is an absolute game-changer. And I truly don't know why it took me so long to test out this masterpiece.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But let's make up for lost time by getting into the nitty-gritty of what makes it so good.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With argan oil (my absolute fave), as well as sustainably-sourced manketti mut and ximenia oils being some of the key ingredients in the formula, it's easy to see why this is an award-winning product. Together, they work to add shine, control frizz, and nourish the scalp.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$55; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">thirteenlune.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, seeing as pretty much all hair oils on the market promise to do just that, I can't lie, I was a bit skeptical at first. But baby, I had to eat my words quicker than someone eating soup outside in a snow storm, because this product delivered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My hair has been in braids since the new year, so I've really had to be mindful about scalp care. This oil not only left my scalp feeling hydrated after wash day, but my new growth was shiny and smooth, and my lord, the gorgeous fragrance made me want to whip my hair all over the place just to get a few extra whiffs of it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: InStyle On...

But if you've got the cash to spend, it's worth it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're still not convinced, I'll leave you with this: It completely elevated my wash day. Normally, this would be a small gesture, but anything that makes me feel nice and luxurious during a time when nothing else is, is 100% worth it in my books.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I deserve — and you do too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Good to Go used to be the column where we'd share the beauty products we can't travel without.
