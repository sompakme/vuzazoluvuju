According to her fascinating self-bio on her website, in addition to being a college student who majored in history and architectural history, Stewart also studied art, economics, and literature before going on to work as an institutional stockbroker on Wall Street.

"Her clients included everyone from Unilever to Chanel." Her website also notes that at five-foot-nine-inches-tall, she was also able to land work for both "fashion editorials and fashion shows, as well as ... ads for popular brands, such as Breck, Clairol, and Lifebuoy Soap."</p><p>Stewart occasionally reminds her fans of her past, sharing <a href=#>throwback photos</a>&nbsp;and even offering up&nbsp;tips on how to recreate hairstyles from her modeling days.
