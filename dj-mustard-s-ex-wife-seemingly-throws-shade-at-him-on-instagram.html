The producer just scored his first number one single with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kendrick Lamar</a>'s "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Not Like Us</a>," and he recently <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">welcomed his first child with his girlfriend</a>, Brittany Stroud. He's excelling in ways both professional and personal, but there still seems to be tension between Mustard and his ex-wife, Chanel Thierry. The latter, who has three children with Mustard, posted a message on Instagram on May 31, and many think it's aimed at the West Coast legend.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Thierry used Instagram Threads to vent about someone is two-faced. "What really gets my gears going," she wrote. "Is someone who will throw a rock behind closed doors but in public try to uphold a certain image." No names, no tagged profiles. Fans quickly arrived at the conclusion that Chanel Thierry meant DJ Mustard. The former spouses have had a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">contentious relationship</a> since their divorce was finalized. Thierry accused DJ Mustard of trying to gain custody of their children so that he didn't have to pay child support during an IG rant.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-dj-mustard-s-ex-criticized-people-for-being-fake>DJ Mustard's Ex Criticized People For Being Fake</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">You want to demolish my name!? It’s disgusting," she publicly told Mustard. "The nerve to have me <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">fighting for custody</a> because you are so bitter and don’t want to pay [child support]. I sat in the house YEARS watching them kids while you toured the world." She also claimed that the producer owed her child support, and refused to pay for co-parenting classes. DJ Mustard responded to these accusations in court. He filed paperwork that dismissed the unpaid child support claims outright.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Chanel’s claim that I have starved her out financially since separation is a flat-out lie," the producer's paperwork read. "I continued to pay all of Chanel’s living expenses, including all of her credit card bills. I also continued paying Chanel’s housing costs and the children’s expenses including school tuition." DJ Mustard is still embroiled in a custody battle with Thierry. He filed for sole custody of their oldest son in February. Radar Online reported that the producer wanted to keep a closer eye on his son's education, and transfer him to a different school. No official rulings have been made.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Danilo is a writer based out of San Diego.
