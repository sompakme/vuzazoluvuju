There's top-to-bottom intrigue throughout the lineup as usual. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Doja Cat</a> and Lana Del Rey are headlining the festival for the first time taking the caliber of their performances to new heights. Ska-punk legends No Doubt are reuniting for the first time in nearly a decade to play the festival. Superstars like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ice Spice</a>, Lil Uzi Very, J Balvin, and Peso Pluma will also take the stage.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">But the Saturday night headliner is what's grabbed the attention of most rap fans. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Tyler, The Creator</a> will bring his unique musical and visual style to the main stage. He's performed at Coachella before but this year he will be elevated to a headlining slot for the very first time. In advance of his performance, Tyler bought a Billboard in the valley where the festival is due to be held with a message for fans. "I would love to see y'all faces and not your phone lights" the Billboard reads. Tyler is hardly the first musician to ever speak out against fans using their phones at shows. It's yet to be seen how much the Billboard will help more fans stay in the moment during his show. Check out the Billboard below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-tyler-the-creator-s-new-billboard>Tyler, The Creator's New Billboard</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Tyler, The Creator asking fans to film less during his Coachella headlining slot?
