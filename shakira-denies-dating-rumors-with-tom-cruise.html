Following her <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">2022 breakup</a> with soccer player, Gerard Piqué, she left Barcelona and relocated to Miami, Florida. This week, attended the F1 Miami Grand Prix, which typically is attended by other stars within the industry. Additionally, Shakira had to dodge a new set of dating rumors with actor <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Tom Cruise</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to TMZ, Shakira and Tom Crusie were both of many invited by racer, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Lewis Hamilton</a>, to attend the race on Wednesday. Coincidentally, Shakira is constantly captured several times alongside Tom Cruise. Although there is a possibility to be spotted together, fans could not help but notice how close they are while attending the race. Sources close to Shakira have shut down the rumors as quickly as they began. Their appearance together was by "coincidence" due to them sharing a mutual friend.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-shakira-and-tom-cruise-at-the-f1-miami-grand-prix>Shakira and Tom Cruise At The F1 Miami Grand Prix</h2></span><p>US actor Tom Cruise (R) and Colombian singer Shakira (L) attend the 2023 Miami Formula One Grand Prix at the Miami International Autodrome in Miami Gardens, Florida, on May 7, 2023.

Additionally, she gave a speech that seemingly calls out her ex-boyfriend of 11 years, Gerard Piqué.“But there comes a time in the life of every woman where she no longer depends on someone else to love and accept herself just as she is,” she said. “A time when the search for someone else is replaced by the search for oneself,” she said. Piqué responded to her speech by posting a picture of him and his new girlfriend.&nbsp;In 2022, the couple announced their split. Shakira has been very public with the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">alleged cheating</a> that ended their long-term relationship.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The two have continued to publically reference each other. Earlier this year, Shakira made history gaining 63 million views in a day on her diss song towards her ex called “BZRP Music Sessions #53.” Additionally, the former couple has two sons together. Furthermore, Shakira is continuing to enjoy her single life. Following the race, Shakria enjoyed a boat ride with a group of friends. They seem to be enjoying the Miami heat. She also took to Instagram showing her fit frame in a purple bikini. The "Hips Don't Lie" singer is seeming to be enjoying her new city of Miami.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbIJ1gpRmqqGZm56%2FonnNqKtmnJGptq%2BzjK2mpmWTp8Kqv8Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
