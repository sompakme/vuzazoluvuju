The stellar 10-episode sophomore season ended with the titular restaurant's debut to the public, and though "Friends and Family Night" went well, the staff of The Bear still have a lot of kinks to work out in both their business and personal lives. Though season 2 was released amid a tumultuous time for Hollywood, there was never any doubt that The Bear would get a highly-anticipated third season. Here's everything we know about season 3 of The Bear.</p><h2 id=has-39-the-bear-39-been-renewed-for-a-third-season-3>Has 'The Bear' been renewed for a third season?</h2><p>Yes, chef! <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/the-bear-season-3-renewal-fx-1235637487/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>FX officially renewed</a> the hit dramedy in November2023, giving season 3 the green light five months after season 2's release (and a little over a month after the end of the writers' strike). <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://deadline.com/2023/06/the-bear-season-2-record-streaming-debut-hulu-1235425381/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Deadline</a> had previously reported that season 2's debut was the most-watched premiere of any FX series on Hulu, and was set to break season 1's record as the most-watched single season of a comedy series in FX history.</p><p>“The Bear, which wowed audiences in its first season only to achieve even greater heights in season two, has become a cultural phenomenon,” said Nick Grad, president of FX Entertainment. “We’re so proud to partner with Christopher Storer, Joanna Calo, Josh Senior, and the rest of the creative team, as well as the brilliant cast led by Jeremy Allen White, Ayo Edebiri and Ebon Moss-Bachrach. What they and the crew have done is truly remarkable, and we and our partners at Hulu join fans in looking forward to the next chapter in the story of The Bear.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tPkcRKmXdJqjibWgZVL3bD-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=when-will-season-3-of-39-the-bear-39-premiere-3>When will season 3 of 'The Bear' premiere?</h2><p>The Bear will reopen its kitchen right on schedule. FX has announced that the series will return for its third season on Thursday, <strong>June 27, 2024</strong>, with all 10 episodes dropping that day.</p><p>Season 3 is set to follow follow the comedy's traditional June release calendar, after season 1 landed on Hulu on June 23, 2022, followed by season 2 on June 22, 2023. Earlier this year, during an executive session at the Television Critics Association's 2024 Winter Tour, FX chairman John Landgraf confirmed that The Bear would return "exclusively to Hulu in June," despite fears of a delay due to last year's Hollywood strikes.</p><p>Looking past season 3, creator Christopher Storer and showrunner Joanna Calo already have plans for the show's future in place. In a previous <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://variety.com/2023/tv/features/the-bear-jeremy-allen-white-ayo-edebiris-season-2-1235475312/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Variety</a> profile, the duo said they have a roadmap for the entire series, but they "aren’t sharing just yet how long they see the show going."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ma3vP4bDcWDVD2RW8qmmwY-1920-80.jpg><p>It turns out that The Bear has been quickly moving along behind the scenes. On March 14, 2024, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/the-bear-renewed-season-4-fx-1235852971/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>The Hollywood Reporter</a> revealed that FX reportedly renewed the dramedy for season 4! Per the outlet's sources, The Bear will film seasons three and four back to back, "in a bid to keep the show on its annual release target as the cast and creatives continue to line their calendars with feature work as a result of the show’s widespread success." Seeing how booked and busy Jeremy Allen White and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/ayo-edebiri-best-style-moments/>Ayo Edebiri</a> have been since season 1's breakout success, super-charging The Bear's production would be a smart move.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><p>THR reported that FX declined to comment on their sourcing, so it's unclear exactly when season 4 will air, but sometime in 2025 seems likely.</p><h2 id=is-there-a-trailer-for-39-the-bear-39-season-3-3>Is there a trailer for 'The Bear' season 3?</h2><p>On May 29, FX dropped the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHiwdDFPsZY" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>official trailer</a>, filled with the first glimpses of The Bear season 3's plot. Suffice it to say, the surprisingly peaceful vibe of season 2 will considerably lessen once the chefs get back into the kitchen full-time. Among the clips, we see Carmy and Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) clash as Richie implements the "surprise" skills he learned in season 2; Carmy and Sydney clash as he introduces his "non-negotiables" for how the restaurant should operate; and Carmy and everyone else clash as his perfectionism goes overboard in pursuit of a Michelin star. Meanwhile, a very pregnant Natalie (Abby Elliott) and Uncle Jimmy (Oliver Platt) argue over the financials, and Fak(Matty Matheson) plays Cupid to try to reunite Carmy and Claire (Molly Gordon). It's unclear whether the kitchen will descend back into the chaos of season 1, but it may get close (though hopefully minus a stabbing).</p><p>Before the official trailer arrived, FX released two initial teasers: a cinematic clip that shows Carmy returning to the kitchen (finally freed from the walk-in), and a longer montage showing that even after transforming the beef joint into a classier place, The Bear still has plenty of dysfunction to smooth out behind the scenes.</p><h2 id=who-will-be-in-the-cast-of-39-the-bear-39-season-3-3>Who will be in the cast of 'The Bear' season 3?</h2><p>All of The Bear's beloved cast members are set to return for season 3, including Jeremy Allen White (Carmy), Ayo Edebiri (Sydney), Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Richie), Abby Elliott (Natalie, a.k.a. Sugar), Lionel Boyce (Marcus), Liza Colón-Zayas (Tina), and Matty Matheson (Neil Fak). Oliver Platt and Molly Gordon will also reprise their roles of Uncle Jimmy Cicero and Carmy's now ex-girlfriend Claire.</p><p>There are other notable <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/the-bear-guest-stars-season-2/>season 2 guest stars</a> whose returns depend on where the story goes. It seems possible Jon Bernthal will pop in to play Carmy and Natalie's late brother Michael, who has appeared via flashbacks in both seasons. There's a chance that Jamie Lee Curtis will come back to play the siblings' mother, Donna, as well.</p><p>There has also been speculation that Will Poulter will return to play Marcus's mentor Luca, as the actor was <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://x.com/bestofpoulter/status/1781030745081032799 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>spotted in Chicago</a> during The Bear's filming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tAZ9QQ7Fb8KDgKvCacy2hB-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=what-will-39-the-bear-39-season-3-be-about-3>What will 'The Bear' season 3 be about?</h2><p>Per FX’s official description, season 3 will follow the staff as "they do what it takes to elevate The Bear, their beef stand turned fine dining establishment, to the highest level, all while doing their best just to stay in business."</p><p>The synopsis continues: "Their quest for culinary excellence will propel the crew to new levels and stress the bonds that hold the restaurant together. As the team grows in size, each member will strive to reach a greater level of service within their role. In the restaurant industry, you’re never on solid ground, and with that ever-changing landscape comes new challenges and opportunities. Our chefs have learned that every second counts, but this season we’ll find out if they have what it takes to make it to tomorrow."</p><p>More specifically, once The Bear turns a profit, Carmy and Sydney will likely need to work out how to pay Uncle Jimmy back for his massive loan, while still profit-sharing as business partners. The show could also include the fallout of Carmy and Claire's breakup, as the chef (hopefully) tries to find some work/life balance and heal his relationship with his family—potentially coinciding with the birth of Natalie's baby.</p><p>As fans have long speculated, there's always the possibility for even more romance in the show, between Sydney and Marcus, who attempted to ask her out in season 2's final episodes, or even Sydney and Carmy. Anything's possible!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRoq69lo528uL%2BOrZ%2BeZZKarrN50p6YrKeeYoBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
