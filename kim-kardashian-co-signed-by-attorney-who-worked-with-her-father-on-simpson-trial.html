"I think she'll be a sensational lawyer. Look what she did with the President of the United States. She got somebody right out of jail. I think she'll be sensational." When questioned about whether or not Kim will be taken seriously as an attorney, Shapiro said, 'It's gonna be a very difficult and long process for her, doing it the way she's doing it. I wish her the best of luck."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"She told me a year ago she was planning on doing this, so she's serious about it and I hope she is successful...I only know one other person who was able to pass the bar in the way she's doing it without going to law school." Even so, he tips his hat to the reality star. "I give anybody credit who wants to further their education [and] try to do something they've never done and be challenged, and I hope she's successful."</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
