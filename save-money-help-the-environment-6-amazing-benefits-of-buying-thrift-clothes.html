While these markets have always been some of the best places to shop luxury brands at affordable rates, very few people openly admit to patronizing them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b5ba84dca4a70b74.jpg><p class=align-left>And because of how they are sold in open and sometimes crowded market spaces, the perception that thrift items are meant for poor people or those living on a budget thrives.</p><p class=align-left>However, opting for second-hand clothing or Okrika as is popularly called in Nigeria, doesn't make you a cheapskate and here is why.</p><p class=align-left>There are many benefits one stands to gain from shopping from thrift stores and markets and in this article, <strong>Legit.ng </strong>highlights six of them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/edb3d395e6012ce9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Wardrobe essentials for fashionistas: 7 must-have dresses for stylish women</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Check them out below:</p><h2>1. Very affordable/good spending habits</h2><p class=align-left>With thrifting, be rest assured that you're spending 50% (if not less) less than what you would have spent if you decided to visit a mall or boutique.</p><p class=align-left>This is unarguably one of the easiest ways to get good items of clothing without breaking the bank.</p><h2>2. You may discover designer products at a fraction of the price</h2><p class=align-left>Let's face it, high-end designer brands may be coveted and high in demand but they rarely come cheap.</p><p class=align-left>However, it's amazing the prices these same designer clothes often retail for at thrift stores and markets. One can get a designer dress that would normally sell for about N20,000, for N3,000 or even less at a local thrift store.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/edb3d395e6012ce9.jpg><h2>3. Thrifting helps you curate your wardrobe with unique clothes</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0561bba6528fb843.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Most consumed goods in Nigeria</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If Zara or Asos releases a new collection this season and you're one of those who buy, best believe you're sure to step out rocking the same look with 4 or 5 other people.</p><p class=align-left>However, with thrift items, you're provided with a diverse assortment of clothing, meaning you’re less likely to find yourself wearing the same top or sweater as a friend or co-worker.</p><h2>4. Thrifting is good for the environment</h2><p class=align-left>Thrifting is a great way to recycle. By choosing to shop preloved items over newly produced pieces, you're limiting the amount of natural resources it takes to create new fabrics, make the clothing, and ship it hundreds or thousands of miles to the store.</p><h2>5. You can find genuine vintage items</h2><p class=align-left>For many people, thrifting is like a treasure hunt as the thrill of what one may find in a thrift market is always exciting to anticipate. Vintage fashion is big right now and if you're looking to spice things up the old school way, thrift markets are the best places to visit.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6oc71orgp4u.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top Hausa traditional attires for guys</span></p></a><h2>6. Find items that are no longer made</h2><p class=align-left>Whether you’re looking for an iconic shirt or dress that was only made in the 80s, thrift shops are often your best bet to find items that are no longer in production.</p><p class=align-left>So, when next you feel that sense of shame creep in due to your urge to visit a thrift market, think of all these reasons why you're going for preloved items!</p><h2>Nigerian fashionista uses fabric bleach to design two-piece ensemble</h2><p class=align-left>A Nigerian lady identified as @omijuju1 on Twitter, recently got social media users talking after sharing photos of an outfit she made using different things including fabric bleach.</p><p class=align-left>There are many people who believe making designs with bleach is super fun and it’s a great way to show your sense of style and personality and Omijuju is one of them.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel=noopener>In the photos shared</a>, the stylish dressmaker is seen posing in a long-sleeved crop top with a fitted mini skirt.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6fmKygmaS7cH2Tbmpwb2liwKLCxGakqKaVrnqpscupZJ6mpp6%2FsLrMnqWtZWZirq6t2aKloGWSmrumssitqmaapa62r7OMrZ%2BroZapeqS4zq2fnqtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
