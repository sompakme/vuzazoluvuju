The iconic 2001 comedy has been a staple <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g29080194/feel-good-happy-movies/>feel-good movie</a> and one of the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g37260832/2000s-movies/>best films from the 2000s</a> for over two decades—inspiring millions of girls to approach their dreams with their full, authentic selves—and now it's officially making a comeback. After fans have been clamoring for a return of the film series for years, and with Legally Blonde 3 still in limbo, it's been confirmed that <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/legally-blonde-tv-series-amazon-prime/>Elle Woods will get a television debut</a>.</p><p>On May 14, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/legally-blonde-tv-series-amazon-reese-witherspoon-josh-schwartz-stephanie-savage-1235961070/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Variety</a> reported that a Legally Blonde prequel series is in the works at <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/amazon-prime-video/>Amazon Prime Video</a>, with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/reese-witherspoon/>Reese Witherspoon</a> set to executive produce. Created by Insecure alum Laura Kittrell, the show, titled Elle, will depict the "origin story" of Elle Woods, during her high school years in the '90s. According to the official description, viewers can expect to "learn about the life experiences that shaped her into the iconic young woman we came to know and love in the first Legally Blonde film."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rZN8ymGhwYSbvj3UhSnyyY-1920-80.jpg><p>"I truly couldn’t be more excited about this series!” Witherspoon said in a statement. “Fans will get to know how Elle Woods navigated her world as a teenager with her distinct personality and ingenuity, in ways that only our beloved Elle could do. What could be better than that? I’m extremely grateful to the incredible teams at Prime Video and Hello Sunshine—along with our amazing writer Laura Kittrell—for making this dream of mine come true. Legally Blonde is back!"</p><p>So what do we know about the highly-anticipated series so far? Read on for everything we know so far about the Legally Blonde prequel.</p><h2 id=when-will-the-39-legally-blonde-39-prequel-series-be-released-3>When will the 'Legally Blonde' prequel series be released?</h2><p>The Legally Blonde TV series is still in its very early days; though it officially has the greenlight, Amazon MGM Studios has yet to announce any other details. Any possible release date will depend on how long it takes to write the script and cast our new Elle Woods (a daunting task!), but odds are we'll at least see the series arrive on streaming by 2026.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tAEFNgQhwYYXV3BpC3vUQM-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=who-has-been-cast-in-the-39-legally-blonde-39-prequel-series-3>Who has been cast in the 'Legally Blonde' prequel series?</h2><p>With the series still in development, there has yet to be an announcement regarding who will play Elle Woods as a teenager growing up in Los Angeles' Bel Air neighborhood. Perhaps they'll tap a young unknown to play the SoCal fashion fiend, or they may cast someone with star power who's been having a major moment. (We're looking at you, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/sabrina-carpenter/>Sabrina Carpenter</a>!) When Witherspoon brought the character to life, she had already been a well-known teen star with roles in <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g22520389/best-90s-movies/>classic '90s movies</a> like Cruel Intentions, Election, Fear, Pleasantville, and other films, but Legally Blonde catapulted her to even further success.

Most of the original film's cast have said they'd be down to return—from Witherspoon herself to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/jennifer-coolidge-legally-blonde-3/>Jennifer Coolidge</a> to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a26124238/luke-wilson-legally-blonde-3/>Luke Wilson</a>.
