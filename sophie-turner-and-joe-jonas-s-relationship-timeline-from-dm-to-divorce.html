The couple's split made international headlines after Jonas <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from his wife of four years on September 5, 2023.</p><p>The musician and actor married in 2019 and have two young children together; while they've kept their relationship fairly private throughout the years — <a href=#>the name of their second child</a> was only revealed to the public thanks to their custody proceedings and court documents — the couple has given us momentary glimpses into their happier moments. Turner even once appeared in a Jonas Brothers music video with her sisters-in-law.</p><p>Below, dive into the former couple's complete relationship timeline, from the Instagram DM that started it all to their spontaneous Vegas wedding to the start of their family, and… their divorce.</p><h2><strong>March 19, 2024: Turner asks a judge to “reactivate” the divorce case.</strong></h2><p>According to court documents obtained by&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a>, Sophie Turner wants to "reactivate" her divorce case with Joe Jonas — and her legal team has already filed a formal petition to do so with a judge.</p><p>On March 19, 2024,&nbsp;People&nbsp;reported that Turner's lawyers filed paperwork in Miami-Dade County, Florida, where Jonas reportedly first filed for a dissolution of marriage in September 2013, stating that “the abatement has come to an end, and this case is to be reactivated.”</p><p>The abatement refers to the <a href=#>interim custody agreement</a> the former couple reached in late 2023, which had January 7, 2024, as its end date. The agreement allowed Turner and Jonas's two children to travel freely between the United States and the United Kingdom, with the latter being their permanent residence.</p><p>After&nbsp;People&nbsp;broke the news, a representative for Joe Jonas added that “the filing was a legal formality, and the couple continues to negotiate an amicable resolution.” Looks like custody battles are not over for these two.</p><h2><strong>October 28, 2023: Turner is seen kissing a new man in Paris.</strong></h2><p>It seems as though Turner is ready to leave the past in the past. On October 28, <a href=#>the actor was spotted kissing British aristocrat Peregrine Pearson</a> while in Paris for the Rugby World Cup finals. According to The Sun, the two were laughing and chatting before Pearson removed his hat and planted a big kiss on Turner before they drove away in separate cars, though the two were also seen together at the event.</p><p>As <a href=#>noted by People</a>, Pearson belongs to one of Britain's wealthiest families and is heir to the <a href=#>16,500 acre</a> Cowdray Estate in West Sussex. He previously dated Princess Maria-Olympia of Greece and Denmark from 2020 to 2023. Soon after Turner was spotted kissing Pearson, <a href=#>The Daily Mail</a> reported that Joe Jonas feels she's moving on “too soon.”</p><p>“What is important for Joe is the well-being of his kids and finishing the tour he is on with his brothers,” a source told the British outlet. “If Sophie wants to gallivant and kiss whomever in public, he doesn't really want to play those games… Granted it feels a little too soon, he has no control over what she does and can only try to figure out the best co-parenting agenda for them both.”</p><p><h2><strong>October 11, 2023: Jonas and Turner come to a new interim custody agreement.</strong></h2></p><p>After “successful” mediation sessions, Turner and Jonas came to a temporary agreement regarding custody of their two daughters, 3-year-old Willa and <a href=#>15-month-old Delphine</a>. The former couple has worked out arrangements through early 2024; they're required to share further plans with the courts by December 23.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHEp62on6Wae6S7zGiqraeirny0u8%2BhoJ5lpKq%2Fr7HRZqGonV2fvK%2Bt0mapnqSRqbawutKhoKlllJ7DsL7CnmStoZ2auaq6xA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
