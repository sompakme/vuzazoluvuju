In addition to "<a href=#>Criminal Minds</a>," Mantegna is known for his work on "The Godfather Part III," "Joan of Arcadia," and his breakthrough role in "Glengarry Glen Ross." He's also an award-winning stage actor who has appeared in several on- and off-Broadway productions, per his <a href=#>IMDb</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But perhaps his forgotten role was in "Frasier," where he played Derek Mann. Mann's whole&nbsp;schtick&nbsp;is that he's a vocal critic of Dr. Frasier Crane, to the point that it nearly came to fisticuffs. He wrote a column in the newspaper called "I Hate Frasier Crane" — how much more obvious can his hatred get? But you know how "Frasier" goes — it's all about callers, which means Derek wasn't&nbsp;actually on screen, so we never got to see Mantegna.</p><p>But Frasier, played by Kelsey Grammer, diffused the situation perfectly. When Mann called into the show to set up a fight with the good doctor, <a href=#>his response was,</a> "I just don't think that civilized people behave that way. You know, Roz, perhaps our listeners have an opinion about that subject?" Well done!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW1nboJze9OhnGabop66qrrApWSmoZ6ZwG6%2F05qpZrGfqnqnu9Ggpq1lkaW9pq3RnptmoZ5is7Ot0qKcq2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
