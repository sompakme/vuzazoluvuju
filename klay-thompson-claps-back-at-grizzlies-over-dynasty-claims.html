The young stars of the Grizzlies, like Dillon Brooks and Ja Morant, have rubbed him the wrong way. Overall, he does not care for their cocky attitudes, and he has made it his mission to teach them a lesson.</p><p>Klay Thompson #11 of the Golden State Warriors warms up prior to the start of the game against the Memphis Grizzlies at Chase Center on December 25, 2022 in San Francisco, California.

In fact, he had a ton of smoke for them. In the clip below, you can see Thompson going off on the team, noting just how much their tough talk is all for nothing.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“Man, they [were] talking about dynasty and all that, you can’t talk dynasty when you haven’t won before,” Thompson explained. “I don’t think people realize how hard that is, the commitment and sacrifice it takes. You got to sacrifice your body and I thought that was premature talk to even mention that word.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">After shooting a basket over the head of Brooks, Thompson hit him with the ultimate taunt. Brooks was on the ground, although that did not stop Thompson from being a complete menace out there. The Warriors superstar continues to yell in his face, and the crowd absolutely loved it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Overall, the new rivalry between these two teams is a lot of fun. Hopefully, we see them battle each other in the playoffs again sometime soon.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of Thompson's remarks in the comments below.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
