The athlete split her pants wide open while stretching during a warm-up for a run at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Unfortunately for Cooke, the camera was directly behind her when her wardrobe malfunction occurred, giving <a href=#>those watching</a> a full view of her behind.</p><p dir=ltr>Cooke didn't seem too embarrassed, however, and even found something positive in splitting her pants. She told <a href=#>The Sun</a>, "It's a good way to break the ice, especially with new team-mates â€” it always gets a laugh." The racer did point out though, "I'm just so grateful I was wearing underwear that day." Cooke seemed to be sporting a black thong, a reasonable choice to wear under those super-tight racing suits that would probably cling to any other kind of undergarments. With a fitted wardrobe like that needed for racing, it's no surprise that one false move would cause a rip.</p><p dir=ltr>While Cooke said having her butt exposed was "Bloody freezing," she knew she couldn't let it stop her, or her team would be disqualified. "I blocked it out until I got in the sleigh and sat down, when I was suddenly reminded it was mighty cold," she recalled. Since then, the clip of her wardrobe malfunction reached over a million views on YouTube, with Cooke noting, "It's fair to say my glute is more famous than my face."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlgboJxe86lsKaomZh6qK3MnqpmpZ%2BowW6t1qSumqqUYsSivsOrppudXaKurbLUp5qtoZ%2BjwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
