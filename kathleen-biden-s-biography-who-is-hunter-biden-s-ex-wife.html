Besides that, not much is known about the early years of Hunter's <a href=#>ex-wife</a>. She is currently 51 years old, although precise date of her birth is not available.</p><h3>Education</h3><p class=align-left>Buhle attended Saint Ignatius College Prep from 1983 to 1987. After completing her studies there, she went to St. Mary's University, where she graduated from in 1991. Kathleen received a BA in Psychology.</p><h3>Relationship between Hunter and Kathleen Biden</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/495b11c7a113f04a.png><p class=align-left>Besides her contribution to the Eleanor Roosevelt Dialogue, Kathleen is best known for her relationship and marriage to her former husband, Hunter Biden. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The two met</a> in 1992 when they were volunteering at the Jesuit Volunteer Corps Northwest.</p><p class=align-left>Kathleen was engaged in social affairs that dealt with adults with mental issues, such as war veterans.

However, the marriage would <a href=#>later end in divorce</a> after several issues arose between Kathleen and Hunter.</p><h3>Kathleen and Hunter's divorce</h3><p class=align-left>Kathleen and Hunter were together for 22 years before separating in 2015. One of the issues leading to the separation was Hunter's reported struggle with addiction to drugs.</p><p class=align-left>In 2016, <a href=#>Hunter Biden's</a> ex-wife, Kathleen, filed for divorce, stating that her husband spent money extravagantly, creating financial concerns for the entire family. She went on to state that her husband misused money on his own interests, such as strip clubs, prostitutes, alcohol, and other drugs.</p><p class=align-left>She claimed that Hunter would then leave his family with insufficient money to cover their day-to-day bills.</p><h3>Kathleen and Hunter's kids</h3><p class=align-left>Kathleen and Hunter share three daughters. The first-born, Naomi Biden, was born in 1999 and named after President Biden’s daughter, who passed on in 1972. The second-born daughter, Finnegan Biden, was born in 2000 and named after her great grandmother.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dffa8b02f2d1896e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mary Austin: where is Freddie Mercury’s former partner now?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The couple’s last-born daughter, Maisy Biden, was born in 2001.</p><h3>Where is Kathleen Biden today?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8aee044ffc04e2fb.jpg><p class=align-left>Kathleen Biden <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">now works at</a> DC Volunteer Lawyers Project as a Director Of Strategic Partnerships.
