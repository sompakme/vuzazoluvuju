In new court papers filed Monday, <span data-scayt_word=Curanaj data-scaytid=3>Curanaj</span>&nbsp;suggests that the station’s managing editor began tracking her every movement and that announcements were made over the intercom system where she worked in an effort to paint her as a poor employee.</p><p>As Fox continues to deal with allegations of “top-down harassment” from many women even after settling with Gretchen Carlson and cutting ties with Roger <span data-scayt_word=Ailes data-scaytid=7>Ailes</span>, <span data-scayt_word="Curanaj's" data-scaytid=8>Curanaj’s</span> lawsuit presents the question of whether the troubles will extend beyond Fox News and impact the local affiliates owned by <span data-scayt_word=21st data-scaytid=6>21st</span> Century Fox.</p><p>In her <a href=#>original complaint</a>, <span data-scayt_word=Curanaj data-scaytid=10>Curanaj</span> (real name: <span data-scayt_word=Lidija data-scaytid=17>Lidija</span>&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Ujkic data-scaytid=18>Ujkic</span>) attempted to leverage the unfolding scandal at Fox’s cable news division by discussing her own experience with former Fox News head <span data-scayt_word=Ailes data-scaytid=12>Ailes</span>. She claimed being repeatedly denied a full-time position because of her age and being rejected for a job at Fox News because Roger&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Ailes data-scaytid=13>Ailes</span>&nbsp;realized she would be “unwilling to submit to him, sexually.” But she didn’t directly work for <span data-scayt_word=Ailes data-scaytid=14>Ailes</span>. Nor is he a co-defendant in this case. As a freelancer, <span data-scayt_word=Curanaj data-scaytid=11>Curanaj</span>&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;the station’s news director said she was “not attractive enough” to be an anchor and complains how her hours were cut upon becoming pregnant.</p><p>Fox <a href=#>reacted to the lawsuit two ways</a> in court.</p><p>First, it argued that <span data-scayt_word=Curanaj data-scaytid=22>Curanaj</span> wasn’t an employee of&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=21st data-scaytid=23>21st</span>&nbsp;Century Fox and that she shouldn’t be allowed to sue the parent company of&nbsp;Fox Television Stations.</p><p>Second, it moved to strike <span data-scayt_word="Curanaj's" data-scaytid=26>Curanaj’s</span>&nbsp;“irrelevant, prejudicial and time-barred allegations” about <span data-scayt_word=Ailes data-scaytid=27>Ailes</span>.&nbsp;</p><p><span data-scayt_word="Curanaj's" data-scaytid=30>Curanaj’s</span> lawyers have decided instead to double down.</p><p>The amended complaint mentions the <span data-scayt_word=Ailes data-scaytid=31>Ailes</span> “stories of more than 25 women,” the federal law enforcement investigation and even the $13 million in reported payments by <span data-scayt_word="O'Reilly" data-scaytid=32>O’Reilly</span> to settle claims of sexual harassment.</p><p>“Disturbingly, the allegations against <span data-scayt_word=O’Reilly data-scaytid=40>O’Reilly</span> are substantially similar to the claims against <span data-scayt_word=Ailes data-scaytid=36>Ailes</span>,” states the complaint. “Upon information and belief, <span data-scayt_word=Ailes data-scaytid=37>Ailes</span> knew of <span data-scayt_word=O’Reilly’s data-scaytid=47>O’Reilly’s</span> unlawful conduct but failed to discipline <span data-scayt_word=O’Reilly data-scaytid=41>O’Reilly</span>, as <span data-scayt_word=Ailes data-scaytid=38>Ailes</span> was busy engaging in the exact same behavior. Additionally, as with settlements involving <span data-scayt_word=Ailes data-scaytid=39>Ailes</span>, the same key executives would have been involved in the execution and disbursement of settlements involving <span data-scayt_word=O’Reilly data-scaytid=42>O’Reilly</span>. For example, such individuals include Mark <span data-scayt_word=Kranz data-scaytid=48>Kranz</span>, Dianne Brandi and Denise Collins.”</p><p>It’s not clear how this is relevant to her own case, and the lawsuit lacks specifics on how Fox’s upper brass new about her situation, but nevertheless, the amended complaint does add some noteworthy new elements about the alleged retaliation she faced after suing. Her lawyers write she was subjected to “unprecedented <span data-scayt_word=micromanagement data-scaytid=49>micromanagement</span> and performance counseling on a nearly daily basis” as a result of filing her first complaint.</p><p>For instance, in the days after filing, she says, her personal <span data-scayt_word=cellphone data-scaytid=50>cellphone</span> stopped working, so she got permission to go to a Verizon store to have it repaired. But when she did, she was admonished by Peter <span data-scayt_word=Facini data-scaytid=51>Facini</span>, the station’s managing editor, she says.</p><p>“Of course, Ms. <span data-scayt_word=Curanaj data-scaytid=52>Curanaj</span> was well within her rights to stop briefly into a store as would any employee on a break be entitled to enter a store,” states the amended complaint. “Moreover, her performance was exemplary that day as Ms. <span data-scayt_word=Curanaj data-scaytid=53>Curanaj</span> was able to complete her story a full half hour before it was slotted to air.”</p><p>She also says she was chastised for making a minor error in a story that was lauded by its subjects and that the overall intent was clear: “create a paper trail in an effort to justify an impending discriminatory and retaliatory termination.”</p><p><span data-scayt_word=Curanaj data-scaytid=61>Curanaj</span> says that her lawsuit was “announced” to the <span data-scayt_word=Fox5 data-scaytid=63>Fox5</span> team in multiple meetings with a design to “alienate and ostracize her,” plus more.</p><p>“For example, <span data-scayt_word=Facini data-scaytid=64>Facini</span> continued to monitor Ms. <span data-scayt_word=Curanaj’s data-scaytid=68>Curanaj’s</span> time in an unprecedented manner,” write her lawyers at <span data-scayt_word=Wigdor data-scaytid=69>Wigdor</span>, discussing what allegedly happened on Dec. 26 when she was in a bathroom and frantic queries of her whereabouts came from <span data-scayt_word=Facini data-scaytid=65>Facini</span>.</p><p>“Concerned that something important had happened, Ms. <span data-scayt_word=Curanaj data-scaytid=70>Curanaj</span> called him back from a stall in the bathroom,” continues the complaint. “Thereafter, she ran to the newsroom to meet <span data-scayt_word=Facini data-scaytid=73>Facini</span> to learn that the purported ’emergency’ was not even breaking news and another <span data-scayt_word=Fox5 data-scaytid=75>Fox5</span> employee was already on the scene. Additionally, announcements were made over the intercom system paging Ms. <span data-scayt_word=Curanaj data-scaytid=71>Curanaj</span> while she was in the bathroom. Given that Ms. <span data-scayt_word=Curanaj data-scaytid=72>Curanaj</span> was in the final trimester of her pregnancy, she should not have had to to worry each time she needed to use the bathroom that <span data-scayt_word=Facini data-scaytid=74>Facini</span> would be attempting to accuse her of poor performance or absence from work.”</p><p><span data-scayt_word=Curanaj data-scaytid=82>Curanaj</span>&nbsp;also says she learned the station’s news director made comments how she “is a liar looking for a payout,” how “anyone who backs her up will go down too because she has no case” and “she’s never going to get another job in TV again.”</p><p>Fox hasn’t responded yet to a request for comment, but the amended complaint includes word that management denied making disparaging comments about the case and told employees that they are to continue working with her as if the lawsuit had not been filed.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmn6eoYr%2BmvM6rq56qXaiuur%2BMoZyrZZikwLW1y55ksKeioL2trcKeZKWZp6jCqsCMpZydZZ2kv6Z50Z6rmqSZlsGqu81mcHJqZ2V%2BcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
