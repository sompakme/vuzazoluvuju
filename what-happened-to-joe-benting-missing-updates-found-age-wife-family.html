According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), motorcyclists are 28 times more likely than passenger car occupants to die in a traffic crash. In 2019, there were 5,014 motorcyclist fatalities in the United States. Some of the common factors that contribute to motorcycle crashes are speeding, alcohol impairment, lack of helmet use, road hazards, and driver error.</p><p>The case of Joe Benting also raises questions about the safety and security of bars and pubs where young people often hang out and drink. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), excessive alcohol use is responsible for more than 95,000 deaths in the United States each year. Some of the harmful effects of alcohol include impaired judgment, coordination, and reaction time; increased aggression and violence; increased risk of injuries and accidents; and increased risk of chronic diseases and mental health problems.</p><p>The case of Joe Benting also reminds us of the importance of family and community support for people who are grieving and traumatized by the loss of a loved one. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), grief is a natural response to losing someone or something that is important to us. Grief can cause physical, emotional, cognitive, behavioral, social, and spiritual changes in people. Some of the common symptoms of grief are shock, denial, anger, guilt, sadness, anxiety, fear, loneliness, numbness, and confusion. Some of the ways to cope with grief are seeking professional help, joining a support group, expressing emotions, maintaining routines, taking care of oneself, and honoring the memory of the deceased.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Joe Benting was a 23-year-old man who went missing on October 22, 2023, after leaving a bar in Easton on his white street bike.
