While these "milk spots" or "oil seeds" are often mistaken for whiteheads, these tiny pearl-like bumps that form under the epidermis aren't considered <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>acne</a> — they're a common skin condition called milia. You can get milia at any age — even as a newborn. Sometimes, it's due to genetics, says Michele Green, M.D. Other causes, however, can include none other than your eye cream. More specifically, thick, pore-clogging formulas.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, this doesn't mean abandoning your eye creams by any means, but if you're someone who experiences milia or has a family that does, then it could benefit you to pay extra attention to the type of eye creams you're using. There can be other causes for milia too, but the good news is, there are ways to treat it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, we turned to experts to find out everything you need to know about milia, including what it is, how to get rid of it, and whether or not you can prevent it in the first place.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-milia></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What is milia?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Derived from the Greek word for "seed," milia are tiny cysts that appear as small, white-ish-looking bumps, says Michele Farber, M.D., FAAD. Milia forms when a buildup of dead skin cells, keratin, and sebum gets trapped beneath the skin surface, causing tiny raised white bumps. They're typically found under the eyes but can also appear in other areas of the face like the nose, chin, and apples of the cheeks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Farber, milia can appear spontaneously or as a result of trauma. "Allergies or chronic rubbing, particularly around the eyes, can precipitate milia development," she says. Other traumatic causes for milia can be burns, rashes, sun damage, or abrasive skin treatment, like dermabrasion, adds Annie Gonzalez, M.D., FAAD.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Using thick products and formulas can also lead to milia development due to the clogging of pores, which is how using a thick eye cream can be a secret culprit. "Using a thicker eye cream can clog your pores, and if you're not cleansing or exfoliating properly, keratin can begin to build," says Dr. Gonzalez. "Once keratin builds into your pores, milia can form."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lastly, Dr. Gonzalez says milia can also occur due to aging. As we get older, our skin's natural exfoliating abilities tend to slow down, resulting in clogged pores and keratin buildup.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-prevent-milia></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Prevent Milia</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Avoid using thick products that contain <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>mineral oil</a> and petroleum, which can clog pores. Instead, opt for non-comedogenic products formulated with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>retinol</a> or peptides, says Dr. Farber. "Eye creams containing peptides are great for stimulating collagen in this gentle area without clogging," she says. Retinoids are also great for the prevention of milia and can be used around the eye area, she adds. The key to using retinol around the eye is to stick to a formula infused with hydrating and gentle ingredients, like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Olay Eyes Pro-Retinol Eye Treatment</a> to avoid irritation.</p><p>Dr. Green also suggests adding an exfoliator into your regular skincare routine to prevent the formation of milia. After cleansing, "select a toner with alpha hydroxy acids like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>salicylic</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>glycolic</a> –these ingredients facilitate cell turnover and remove dead skin cells," she says. "Finish by using a lightweight moisturizer, since moisturizing replenishes the skin and hydrates your skin cells."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also recommends looking for a moisturizer with that's gel-based or lightweight, preferably with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hyaluronic acid</a>. "These elements provide your skin with the nourishment it needs without clogging the pores."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We're fans of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Mario Badescu's Glycolic Toner</a> which resurfaces skin cells and contains soothing aloe vera. As for moisturizer, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Neutrogena's Hydro Boost</a> is a fast-absorbing gel moisturizer infused with skin-plumping hyaluronic acid.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-get-rid-of-milia></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Get Rid of Milia</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike whiteheads or blackheads, milia won't budge, no matter how hard you squeeze. Using traditional topical acne treatments won't get rid of them either. "Milia are often mistaken for whiteheads but the distinction is they do not respond to acne medication or treatment and must be extracted by a dermatologist," Dr. Green explains. "You should not attempt to squeeze or try to extract them on your own as this can cause trauma to the skin and scarring."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Typically, a dermatologist will use a small lancet to safely remove the skin overtop. "Once the pore is open, it will allow your dermatologist to remove the contents of the milia," says Dr. Green. Electrodessication, an in-office treatment that uses an electrical current to remove skin lesions like skin tags, can also be used to extract milia.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-to-see-a-professional></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When to See a Professional</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In most cases, milia will go away on their own after a few weeks. However, if you notice your milia lasting longer than that or you want to get rid of them fast, you can see a skin care professional to have your milia removed in-office.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Beauty Now: Face Gym</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeYpMRuwM5mnp6sXae2pXnOn2SmoZyerg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
