Captain Marvel — in an earlier guise as “Ms. Marvel” — is rumored to make an appearance in Joss Whedon’s Avengers: Age of Ultron, making Sackhoff’s earlier Twitter teases about a “super secret job” even more enticing to fans, despite her later clarification that it was not a Marvel project. <a href=../../no-katee-sackhoff-isn-t-captain-marvel-in-avengers-2.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../prince-albert-latest-news-pictures-videos.html>Prince Albert: Latest News, Pictures &amp;amp; Videos</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

Forensic experts matched the human remains recovered in 1996 from Fox Hollow Farm, the former Westfield property of suspected serial killer Herb Baumeister, to then-34-year-old Manuel Resendez, Hamilton County Coroner Jeff Jellison said in a press release.
Resendez was reported missing in 1993. <a href=../../remains-found-at-indiana-estate-of-suspected-serial-killer-identified-as-victim-who-has-been-missing.html>Read More...</a></section></article></div><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../page/383/index.html>&lt; Prev</a>
