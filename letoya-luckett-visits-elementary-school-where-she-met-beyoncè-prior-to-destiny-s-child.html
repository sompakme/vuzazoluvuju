She saw I had a love for singing, and she was doing Star Search, big things. I was in a group with my cousins at the time. So,&nbsp;we were&nbsp;both kinda doing our thing.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It was Beyoncé's suggestion that Luckett&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">audition for her father</a> days after meeting him.
