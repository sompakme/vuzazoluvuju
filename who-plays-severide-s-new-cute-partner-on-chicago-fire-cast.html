It suggests that she could also be tapped to guest star in another future episode of the show.</p><p>Before taking on this role, Jana actually shared the small screen with Sophia Bush from Chicago P.D. They both used to star on One Tree Hill, which then led to Sophia becoming Detective Erin Lindsay on the P.D. cast.</p><p>Additional roles that viewers may have seen Jana play were in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">holiday films</a> The Christmas Fix Up and Christmas in Mississippi.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More to come from Chicago Fire</h2><p>There was a lot of drama within the January 11 episode of Chicago Fire, and it extended beyond the case that Severide was working on.</p><p>Violet Mikami discovered audio recordings where Chief Evan Hawkins spoke about Emma Jacobs trying to blackmail him.
