The most sought-after locations? Vancouver and Toronto – the two major Canadian cities that have been favorites with foreign investors for many years. According to some estimates, over 50 per cent of homes in Toronto are internationally owned.&nbsp;</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Design expertise in your inbox – from inspiring decorating ideas and beautiful celebrity homes to practical gardening advice and shopping round-ups.</p><p>Jane Londerville, a real estate professor at the University of Guelph in Southern Ontario, has <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/23/foreign-cash-driving-top-end-house-prices-in-vancouver-and-toronto referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>explained</a> that the popularity of Canada is due to its image as 'a very safe, calm economy', safe for investing.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=3-costa-rica-2>3.

It's not really surprising given the increasing prominence of this tropical country as a place with good governance, unspoiled natural beauty, and leadership on climate change action.&nbsp;</p><p>What's even better is the fact that Americans have the same rights as Costa Ricans when it comes to home ownership. And – Costa Rica is actively building condos, including in popular locations such as Tamarindo<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;Jaco. While Costa Rica is quite a bit further away from the US than Mexico, it will appeal to buyers who want a home in a more tranquil and pristine location.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvMnqqappScrrOwxKeqZ5ufonyvsdasZqano6l6sbvPrqOaql2hvKSt06Kmp6tdm7yzedSsZKGnnZqvtsXEq6o%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
