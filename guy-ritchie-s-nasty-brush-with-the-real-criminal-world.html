Unfortunately, one of the show's unwitting protagonists didn't take kindly to being the centre of Mr Ritchie's pranks.</p><p id=eVBO2pfzVGr data-wc=22>In the show, members of the public are tempted into committing crimes, little knowing that hidden cameras are recording their every move.</p><p id=evKSIlnjk1a data-wc=51>When the team left an expensive car unlocked in one of London's poorer boroughs, it wasn't long before a passer-by had made himself at home in the driver's seat. His hopes of driving off in style were dashed, however, when the doors locked and the vehicle began filling up with foam.</p><p id=enpPoTrvF4_ data-wc=51>The startled culprit smashed a window in order to escape and grew rather irate when he realised he was being filmed. Running over to the cameraman, he stabbed him in the leg with a screwdriver. His victim was taken to hospital and treated for what was described as a "minor injury".</p><p id=e4_foPKppTD data-wc=40>Channel 5 says it still intends to broadcast <i>Swag</i> despite ethical and legal concerns over the production. While broadcasting watchdogs have no authority to interfere in the making of programmes, the incident has further fuelled the controversy surrounding "reality TV".</p><p id=elxZwM5lqXWc data-wc=30>It may also stoke fears over Madonna's husband's flagging career. His last film, <i>Swept Away,</i> which starred his pop-star wife, bombed at the box office and was panned by critics.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
