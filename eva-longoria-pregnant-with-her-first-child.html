I have to tell you all I did was eat cheese. I ate cheese!" Alongside an image of herself in a bikini, she added: "Everybody's saying I'm pregnant and I'm not.

She said: "I think every relationship is a path to where you are today. Every wrong turn led you to the spot where you are, so it wasn't necessarily the wrong turn at the time.
