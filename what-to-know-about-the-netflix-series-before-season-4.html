The end of season three saw Moordale Secondary closing after the school’s acapella group and swing band performed “Fuck the Pain Away,” causing the school’s investors to withdraw all of their funding. As a result, the students will need to find new schools, which leads the show’s lovable characters to Cavendish.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth and final season</a> of the hit dramedy picks up a few months after the end of the previous installment, as Otis (Asa Butterfield), Eric (Ncuti Gatwa), Aimee (Aimee-Lou Wood), Ruby (Mimi Keene), Jackson (Kedar Williams-Stirling), Viv (Chinenye Ezeudu) and Cal (Dua Saleh) begin a new chapter at a new school.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Meanwhile, Maeve (Emma Mackey) is off studying in America under esteemed author Thomas Molloy, played by Emmy winner Dan Levy; Jean (Gillian Anderson) is adjusting to having a new baby around; and Adam (Connor Swindells) is exploring options outside of typical school.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The final season will also introduce a slew of new faces, including Felix Mufti, Anthony Lexa, Alexandra James, Reda Elazouar, Bella Maclean and Imani Yahshua, as well as Hannah Gadsby, Thaddea Graham, Lisa McGrillis, Marie Reuther, Jodie Turner-Smith and Eshaan Akbar.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The news that Sex Education would not be returning for a fifth season came on the heels of a few castmembers — like Gatwa and Mackey, who co-starred in Greta Gerwig’s Barbie — announcing they were ready to move on from the show and explore other roles.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Below, The Hollywood Reporter breaks down everything there is to know about the final run of Sex Education before season four drops in full on Netflix.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.6701570680628><h2>When Will Sex Education Season 4 Be Released?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Asa-Mimi_-Sex-Education-S4-H-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Sex Education will return for its fourth and final season on Sept. 21, when all eight episodes drop on Netflix. This season will be the last installment centering on Otis, Maeve, Eric and their Moordale peers, as creator Laurie Nunn explained in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a heartfelt note announcing the end of the series </a>that she is taking a break from the world she created and thinking about other things. However, she’s not opposed to returning in some way, shape or form down the line. “Moordale is a really rich world, and writing about teenagers is always a lot of fun,” she told Netflix’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tudum</a>. “So, I think that there’s always potential for more to be explored in that world.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=22.967973495306><h2>Who's Who in the Cast?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Dan-Levy_Sex-Education-S4.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Fans of the Netflix series will be happy to see the return of several of their favorite characters — in addition to some new faces. Returning castmembers include Asa Butterfield (Otis), Gillian Anderson (Jean), Ncuti Gatwa (Eric), Aimee-Lou Wood (Aimee), Emma Mackey (Maeve), Connor Swindells (Adam), Kedar Williams-Stirling (Jackson), Mimi Keene (Ruby), George Robinson (Isaac), Chinenye Ezeudu (Vivienne), Dua Saleh (Cal), Alistair Petrie (Michael) and Samantha Spiro (Maureen).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A couple of the biggest names joining the cast for its final outing are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Dan Levy</a> — making his return to TV since the Emmy-winning final run of Schitt’s Creek — and Queen & Slim‘s Jodie Turner-Smith. Other new faces include Hannah Gadsby, Thaddea Graham, Marie Reuther, Felix Mufti, Anthony Lexa, Alexandra James, Imani Yahshua, Lisa McGrillis, Reda Elazouar and Bella Maclean.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On the other hand, a few familiar characters will not be attending Cavendish Sixth Form College alongside their fellow students. Ahead of the final season, Patricia Allison (Ola), Tanya Reynolds (Lily) and Simone Ashley (Olivia) announced their time on the show was over.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It’s just the natural progression of these shows,”<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Reynolds told RadioTimes</a> of leaving the show. “When you have such big ensemble casts and so many characters, I think you have to let a few older characters go to make way for newer ones, which is absolutely the right thing, the way it should happen.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Allison explained that her departure from the show was due to scheduling conflicts. “I absolutely have loved being on Sex Education so, so much, and playing Ola,” she said on Capital Xtra’s breakfast show in July. “But unfortunately, I won’t be joining the team for season four.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=17.537634408602><h2>Why Is Sex Education Ending?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SE_401_Emma-Mackey-H-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Showrunner Laurie Nunn announced the fourth season would be the last in July, noting that a lot had changed since they first kicked off the show in 2017 from a writers room above a sex shop.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“We wanted to make a show that would answer some of the questions we all used to have about love, sex, friendship and our bodies,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> in a letter posted on social media. “Something that would have helped our inner teenagers feel a little less alone. It’s been overwhelming seeing how the show has connected with people around the world, and we hope it’s made some of you feel a little less alone too.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She explained that it wasn’t an easy decision to end the series now, but it became clear it was the right time to say goodbye, sharing that they were proud of the writers, cast and crew, who put so much into the storyline of the final season.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Goodbyes are the worst,” she concluded, “but let’s celebrate all the good times we’ve had.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Prior to Nunn’s announcement, a few castmembers including Ncuti Gatwa and Emma Mackey expressed being ready to move on from Sex Education. Gatwa previously said that he felt the cast had<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> “outgrown” the show</a>. He added, “We’ve given everything we can to it.” Mackey echoed his sentiment, telling <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hunger</a> that she would not be returning if the show continued beyond season four.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Sex Education is so momentous as a concept, as a show, and the cast are phenomenal,” she said. “I genuinely care about them all a lot, and I made lifelong friends. But the bittersweet nature of it is that I also can’t be 17 my whole life.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=26.579402855907><h2>What Is Season 4 About?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SE_403_Unit_00728_RT.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Season four picks up a couple of months after the closing of Moordale Secondary at the end of the third season. Maeve is in America, studying at Wallace University, while Otis, Eric, Ruby, Aimee, Jackson, Viv, Cal and other Moordale students have transferred to Cavendish Sixth Form College — a very different school than they were used to.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Cavendish is a culture shock for all the Moordale students — they thought they were progressive, but this new college is another level,” the logline reads. “There’s daily yoga in the communal garden, a strong sustainability vibe and a group of kids who are popular for being… kind?!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">At home, Otis is adjusting to no longer being an only child, and, at school, no longer being the only sex therapist around. “Otis starts at Cavendish and quickly realizes that his ambition to start an ethical new sex therapy clinic has been thwarted, because there’s already a talented sex therapist called O on campus,” Nunn told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tudum</a>. “This becomes the catalyst for Otis’ journey in season four.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Eric continues to struggle with his sexuality and faith, while growing more confident in who he is, as well as the reality that he and Otis just aren’t as close anymore. He will also have some mysterious scenes with Jodie Turner-Smith, who previously announced she would be joining the show’s final season, and all of her scenes are with Gatwa’s Eric.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Aimee is single for the first time in a while and doesn’t have her best friend around anymore. “She’s at this new school, and she doesn’t have any mates,” Aimee Lou Wood, who plays Aimee in the show, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>previously told Bustle</a>. “But what’s so amazing is that through art, Aimee finds something that connects her to herself.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Maeve and Otis try to maneuver a long-distance relationship, while she lives out her dream studying at the prestigious American university, under the guidance of Dan Levy’s Thomas Molloy, a professor and famed author.
