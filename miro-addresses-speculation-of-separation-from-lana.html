That said, his good times in AEW didn’t last long and was eventually relegated to a long hiatus from the company. While he remains absent from AEW, Miro decided to mock a fan who claimed he and Lana are separated.</p><p>Miro has not been seen in AEW since All Out, and he has not even competed on Dynamite for several months. This is a huge cause of concern for many fans, as they feel Miro is simply being wasted entirely in the company and deserves better.</p><p>As previously reported,&nbsp;<a href=#>Miro returned to Bulgaria while ago</a> and is still sitting at home as AEW simply does not have<a href=#> anything for him</a>. His continued absence has only led to a rise in rumors.</p><p>Miro is happily married to Lana and they remain a beloved couple. However, a fan took to Twitter and claimed Miro and Lana are separated. Miro replied to the fan and smoked him by referencing his love triangle storyline with Bobby Lashley and Lana.</p><p>Didn’t you know she is with Bobby Lashley still</p><p>There is also the belief that Tony Khan&nbsp;<a href=#>might feel pushing Miro might be waste</a>. The former Rusev wants to&nbsp;<a href=#>win the AEW World Title in the future</a>. Regardless, we’ll have to see what the future holds for Miro when it comes to his status in AEW.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What do you think of what Miro said?
