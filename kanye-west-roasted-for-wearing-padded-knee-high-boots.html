Overall, West has produced some very unique outfits in the past. Of course, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his Yeezy brand with Adidas was a forward-thinking imprint</a>. Although, now not so much thanks to the fact that the two are no longer in business with one another. Moreover, he had some garments with GAP. However, that partnership did not last very long either. Needless to say, Kanye loves fashion but has a hard time when it comes to not letting his ideas wander too aimlessly.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Recently, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">West was out and about with his new wife,</a> Bianca Censori. These two have been seen on quite a few dates as of late. They frequently go get iced cream together, and if you're lucky, you can find them wandering around Los Angeles. Although Censori hasn't spoken about their relationship, they seem to be going strong. Ye is doing his own thing in <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">regard to yet another Presidential campaign</a>, and Censori seems to be supporting him through it all.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kanye-west-bianca-censori>Kanye West & Bianca Censori</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Over the weekend, a photo of Censori and Kanye West began to go viral. While out in Los Angeles, Censori could be seen wearing a white tank top and some leggings with high heels. Meanwhile, Ye wore a very interesting jacket, some leggings, and knee-high padded boots. Overall, this was not Ye's finest moment in the fashion world. So much so that he was immediately roasted by fans for it. In the tweets down below, you can see just how much fans had fun with their commentary on the outfit.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-let-the-roasting-begin>Let The Roasting Begin</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For the most part, it wasn't just Kanye who got some smoke in regard to this outfit. Bianca Censori also got quite a bit of flack for his get-up. The overly-long tights with heels was the main point of contention. Either way, it is clear that these two are operating on a completely different plane of existence than we are. Whether or not that is a good thing, is for you to decide. Let us know what you think of these outfits, in the comments section below.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
